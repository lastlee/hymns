1: Tell Me the Story of Jesus

1. Tell me the story of Jesus;
   Write on my heart every word.
   Tell me the story most precious,
   Sweetest that ever was heard.
   Tell how the angels, in chorus,
   Sang as they welcomed His birth,
   “Glory to God in the highest!
   Peace and good tidings to earth.”

Chorus
	Tell me the story of Jesus;
	Write on my heart every word.
	Tell me the story most precious,
	Sweetest that ever was heard.

2. Fasting, alone in the desert,
   Tell of the days that He passed,
   How for our sins He was tempted,
   Yet was triumphant at last.
   Tell of the years of His labour;
   Tell of the sorrow He bore;
   He was despised and afﬂicted,
   Homeless, rejected and poor.

3. Tell of the cross where they nailed Him,
   Suffering in anguish and pain;
   Tell of the grave where they laid Him,
   Tell how He liveth again.
   Love in that story so tender,
   Clearer than ever I see;
   Stay, let me say, “I will follow
   Him who has suffered for me.”

2: More About Jesus

1. More about Jesus would I know,
   More of His grace to others show;
   More of His saving fullness see,
   More of His love who died for me.

Chorus
	More, more about Jesus;
	More, more about Jesus;
	More of His saving fullness see,
	More of His love who died for me.

2. More about Jesus let me learn,
   More of His holy will discern;
   Spirit of God, my teacher be,
   Showing the things of Christ to me.

3. More about Jesus in His word,
   Holding communion with my Lord,
   Hearing His voice in every line,
   Making each faithful saying mine.

4. More about Jesus on His throne,
   Riches in glory all His own;
   More of His kingdom’s sure increase;
   More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

3: Tell Me Again

1. Tell me again of God’s wonderful love:
   How Jesus left those fair mansions above,
   Suffered and died for my sins on the tree;
   He made atonement for you and for me.

Chorus
	Tell how He lived for me; tell how He died,
	Sorely afﬂicted and nailed to the tree,
	Wounded and bruised for the sins of the world:
	Love so abounding– O tell it to me!

2. Tell me again how He wept for their sin,
   Opened life’s gate that they all might come in;
   But they despised Him and hardened their heart,
   Cast out their Saviour and bid Him depart.

3. Tell me again how in sorrow He prayed;
   All our transgressions on Jesus were laid.
   None was found worthy for sin to atone:
   Death’s bitter cup He must drink all alone.

4. Tell how exceedingly bitter His cry,
   Nailed to the cross where they left Him to die;
   Grieved and forsaken, God spared not His Son:
   Love’s mighty work of redemption is done.

4: O Lamb of God

1. O Lamb of God, wherever Thou dost go,
   Thy blood-stained footprints leaving here below,
   We, too, shall follow by Thy grace so free;
   Through suffering Thou didst get the victory.

2. Born in a stable, not a priestly son,
   Sorrow and suffering Thou didst never shun;
   But though despised, rejected and outcast,
   Thy name exalted is on high at last.

3. Thou art the Pattern, Thou art still the same;
   Despised, rejected, we shall bear Thy name.
   Why should we wish to take a different way,
   With the great crowds who will not do, but say?

4. A few short years to labour with Thee here,
   Seeking for those who will Thy name revere,
   Then to our home where Thou art shall we come;
   Lord, help us lose our lives for Thee alone.

5: To This Earth

1. To this earth to live and labour
   In His Father’s name,
   Poor and homeless, unknown stranger,
   Jesus came.

2. Foxes have their lair for shelter,
   Birds, their leafy nest,
   But the loving Saviour had not
   Where to rest.

3. From this lowly Man of Sorrows
   Many hid their face:
   Shame and scorn were heaped upon Him,
   And disgrace.

4. Oh, that life so pure and holy,
   Sacriﬁced each day,
   Giving freely life and service
   All the way!

5. At the close His blood so precious,
   Shed for all mankind;
   Still His foes were mocking, scoffing–
   They were blind.

6. God has raised up this same Jesus,
   Made Him Lord of all;
   Sons of men, O now receive Him:
   Hear His call.

6: When I Survey

1. When I survey the wondrous cross
   On which the Prince of glory died,
   My richest gain I count but loss
   And pour contempt on all my pride.

2. Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast,
   Save in the cross of Christ, my Lord;
   All the vain things that charm me most–
   I sacriﬁce them to His blood.

3. See, from His head, His hands, His feet,
   Sorrow and love ﬂow mingled down;
   Did e’er such love and sorrow meet,
   Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

4. Were the whole realm of nature mine,
   That were a present far too small;
   Love so amazing, so divine,
   Demands my soul, my life, my all.

1. O tell me more of Christ, my Saviour;
   On this glad theme dwell o’er and o’er;
   His boundless grace, His saving favour,
   His precious name– O tell me more!

Chorus
	O tell me more! So much I need
	His power to keep, His hand to lead;
	O tell me more of Him I love,
	Until I see His face above.

2. O tell me more of love’s sweet story,
   If you would cheer and comfort me–
   How Jesus wept, the King of glory,
   Those tender tears of sympathy.

3. O tell me more! How waves of sorrow
   Shall hear His voice say “Peace, be still”;
   How, after night, bright dawns the morrow
   To those who trust His blessèd will.

4. O tell me more! And I, repeating
   The happy news, shall spread the joy;
   Come, blessèd Lord, Thy work completing,
   Till songs of praise our lips employ.

8: Was It for Me?

1. Was it for me, for me alone,
   The Saviour left His glorious throne,
   The dazzling splendours of the sky:
   Was it for me He came to die?

Chorus
	It was for me, yes, all for me;
	Oh, love of God, so great, so free!
	Oh, wondrous love! Oh, boundless grace!
	He died for me, He took my place.

2. Was it for me sweet angel strains
   Came ﬂoating o’er Judea’s plains
   That starlight night so long ago:
   Was it for me God planned it so?

3. Was it for me He wept and prayed,
   My load of sin before Him laid
   That night within Gethsemane:
   Was it for me, that agony?

4. Was it for me He bowed His head
   Upon the cross and freely shed
   His precious blood, that crimson tide:
   Was it for me the Saviour died?

1. Jesus came from heaven revealing
   God the Father here below,
   All His truth to us declaring,
   That we might His purpose know.

Chorus
	Let us follow, ever follow,
	In His steps, whate’er befall,
	Looking always unto Jesus:
	In His name we conquer all.

2. Deepest darkness is prevailing
   O’er the world on every side,
   But if we will follow Jesus
   We shall in His light abide.

3. He has given His life a ransom
   That the prisoner might go free,
   And has sent His servants warning
   Men from coming wrath to ﬂee.

4. Satan’s power will soon be broken
   When the Prince of Life appears;
   Then the darkness will be over;

1. Jesus is still the same
   And ever will remain
   Through time to come;
   Though born in low estate,
   Not ranked among the great,
   He is the only gate,
   God’s own sent One.

2. “Jesus, control my heart;
   Help me to do my part
   From day to day;
   Help me to yield to Thee,
   That I may always be
   An offering glad and free,
   In Thine own way.”

3. Some bright, glad day His own
   Shall stand around the throne–
   A victor throng:
   The bitter conﬂict o’er,
   Sickness and death no more,
   Singing on that blest shore
   Redemption’s song.

2. No voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
   Nor can the memory ﬁnd

3. O hope of every contrite heart!
   O joy of all the meek!
   To those who fall, how kind Thou art!
   How good to those who seek!

   No tongue nor pen can show;

   I come and long for rest.

3. Long in the desert ways
   My feet have loved to roam;
   The dreary waste I leave behind
   And turn to Thee and home.

4. Earth’s passing pleasures vain,
   How soon they fade and die!
   I sought for bread, but found a stone,

2. I’m glad this rest is free–
   This blessèd rest from sin.

   A living Christ within.

3. He sought my wayward heart,
   Was earnest to come in–
   A heart to wandering ever prone,
   Whose reigning power was sin.

4. I gave to Him my heart,
   A rebel, sinful thing;
   I gave it, all the heart I had–
   It sorely needed Him.

5. My rest is deep and strong,

   Heal the sick and lame,
   Cheer the mourner, still the tempest–
   Glory to His name!

Chorus
	Yesterday, today, forever,
	Jesus is the same;
	All may change, but Jesus never!
	Glory to His name!

2. He who was the Friend of sinners
   Seeks thee, lost one, now;
   Sinner, come, and at His footstool
   Penitently bow.
   He who said, “I’ll not condemn thee:
   Go, and sin no more,”
   Speaks to thee that word of pardon
   As in days of yore.

3. He who mid the raging billows
   Walked upon the sea,
   Still can hush our wildest tempest,
   As on Galilee.
   He who wept and prayed in anguish
   In Gethsemane,
   Drinks with us each cup of trembling,
   In our agony.

   I long to be like Thee–
   All pure within.
   Now let the crimson tide,
   Shed from Thy wounded side,
   Be to my heart applied
   And make me clean.

3. Wash me, O Lamb of God,
   Wash me from sin!
   By faith Thy cleansing blood
   Now makes me clean.
   So near art Thou to me,
   So sweet my rest in Thee–
   Oh, blessèd purity,
   Saved, saved from sin.

4. Wash me, O Lamb of God,

Chorus
	The way of the cross leads home;
	The way of the cross leads home;
	It is sweet to know as I onward go,
	The way of the cross leads home.

2. I must needs go on in the blood-sprinkled way,
   The path that the Saviour trod,
   If I ever climb to the heights sublime,
   Where the soul is at home with God.

3. Then I bid farewell to the way of the world,

   God the Father’s spotless Lamb.

Chorus
	It was Jesus, my Saviour,
	Gave His life to ransom me;
	Love beyond my comprehending,
	When He suffered on Calvary.

2. Not redeemed to vainly squander
   Time and talents He bestows;
   Strength He gives to bear the burden–
   Well this feeble frame He knows.

3. Not redeemed to live in pleasure
   While the precious moments ﬂy;
   Brief our span of life to labour–
   Days and years pass swiftly by.

4. He redeemed me– oh, what mercy!
   Greater love could never be!

   Was the sacriﬁce for me.

   From His radiant throne above,
   Came our Redeemer
   In His wondrous love.
   Oh, what pain and sorrow
   Jesus suffered on the tree
   As He died for sinners,
   Died for you and me.

Chorus
	Saviour, my Saviour,
	Thou hast died to make me free;
	Help me to serve Thee
	Till Thy blessèd face I see.

2. Faint and forsaken,
   Out on Calvary’s mountainside,
   Jesus, my Saviour,
   Bowed His head and died.
   He, our hope and surety,
   All this suffering meekly bore,
   But He rose triumphant,
   Liveth evermore.

3. How can we grieve Him–
   Jesus, blessèd Son of God–
   Him, who so freely
   Gave His precious blood?
   With no hand to help us,
   Drifting to a hopeless grave,
   Jesus paid the ransom:
   He alone could save.

4. Come to the Saviour,
   With thy weary load of care;
   Tell Him thy sorrow;
   He will hear thy prayer.
   He will loose thy burden,
   Make thee victor over sin;
   He will ﬁll with gladness
   All thy heart within.

2. If we but knew the sorrow and the loss,

3. If we but knew the joy His heart has planned,

   He was smitten of God and afﬂicted
   To purchase salvation for thee.

Chorus
	In deep agony,
	Afﬂicted was He;
	When He poured out His soul in His anguish,
	O friend! He was stricken for thee.

2. Is it nothing to you that, in sorrow,
   The Saviour is now passing by?
   “I’d have gathered them in, but they would not”–
   Exceedingly bitter His cry.

3. Is it nothing to you, is it nothing,
   Your many transgressions He bore
   When He purchased eternal redemption,
   That you might be free evermore?

4. Is it nothing to you He is coming–

23: Oh, the Love That Sought Me

1. In tenderness He sought me,
   So weary, sick with sin,
   And on His shoulders brought me
   Back to His fold again,
   While angels in His presence sang
   Until the courts of heaven rang.

Chorus
	Oh, the love that sought me!
	Oh, the blood that bought me!
	Oh, the grace that brought me to the fold–
	Wondrous grace that brought me to the fold!

2. He pointed to the nailprints:
   For me His blood was shed;
   A mocking crown so thorny
   Was placed upon His head.
   I wondered what He saw in me,
   To suffer such deep agony.

3. So while the hours are passing,
   All now is perfect rest;
   I’m waiting for the morning,
   The brightest and the best,
   When He will call us to His side
   To be with Him– His spotless bride.

24: From Every Stain

1. From every stain made clean,
   From every sin set free–
   O blessèd Lord, this is the gift
   That Thou hast promised me;
   And pressing through the past
   Of failure, fault and fear,
   Before Thy cross my all I cast
   And dare to leave it there.

2. From Thee I would not hide
   My sin because of fear,
   What men may think, I hate my pride
   And as I am appear:
   Just as I am, O Lord,
   Not what I’m thought to be;
   Just as I am, a struggling soul,
   For life and liberty.

3. While in Thy light I stand,
   My heart, I seem to see,
   Has failed to take from Thine own hand
   The gift it offers me.
   O Lord, Thy plenteous grace,
   Thy wisdom and Thy power,
   I here proclaim before Thy face,
   Can keep me every hour.

4. Upon the altar here,
   I lay my treasure down;
   I only want to have Thee near,
   King of my heart to crown.
   The ﬁre doth surely burn
   My every selfish claim;
   And while from them to Thee I turn,
   I trust in Thy great name.

25: Jesus, I My Cross Have Taken

1. Jesus, I my cross have taken,
   All to leave and follow Thee,
   Destitute, despised, forsaken,
   Thou, from hence, my all shalt be.

Chorus
	I will follow Thee, my Saviour:
	Thou hast shed Thy blood for me;
	And though all the world forsake Thee,
	By Thy grace I will follow Thee.

2. Perish every fond ambition,
   All I’ve sought and hoped and known;
   Yet how rich is my condition!
   God and heaven are still mine own.

3. Let the world despise and leave me;
   They have left my Saviour too.
   Human hearts and looks deceive me;
   Thou art not, like them, untrue.

4. Man may trouble and distress me;
   ’Twill but drive me to Thy breast.
   Life with trials hard may press me,
   But in Thee I ﬁnd my rest.

26: Thy Life Was Given for Me

1. Thy life was given for me!
   Thy blood, O Lord, was shed
   That I might ransomed be
   And quickened from the dead.
   Thy life was given for me:
   What have I given for Thee?

2. Long years were spent for me
   In weariness and woe,
   That through eternity
   Thy glory I might know.
   Long years were spent for me:
   Have I spent one for Thee?

3. And Thou hast brought to me,
   Down from Thy home above,
   Salvation full and free,
   Thy pardon and Thy love.
   Great gifts Thou broughtest me:
   What have I brought to Thee?

4. Oh, let my life be given,
   My years for Thee be spent,
   World fetters all be riven,
   And joy with suffering blent.
   To Thee my all I bring,
   My Saviour and my King.

27: He First Loved Me

1. There is no friend like Jesus
   On earth, in heaven above:
   Unfailing, never changing,
   His name and nature, love.
   He left His home in glory
   To die on Calvary;
   I cannot help but love Him,
   Because He ﬁrst loved me.

2. My soul was heavy-burdened,
   And sorrow ﬁlled my heart:
   Sin’s fearful condemnation,
   My portion and my part.
   The message came from heaven,
   “I died your soul to free”;
   I cannot help but love Him,
   Because He ﬁrst loved me.

3. How great my consolation!
   The Lamb of God has died;
   In Him I am accepted,
   Forgiven, sanctiﬁed.
   I soon shall join the ransomed–
   My Saviour I shall see;
   I cannot help but love Him,
   Because He ﬁrst loved me.

28: Come, Let Us Follow Jesus

1. Come, let us follow Jesus–
   It is the path of life;
   See, all the faithful trod it
   And conquered in the strife:
   As strangers and as pilgrims,
   They all with one accord
   Through tribulation entered
   The kingdom of our Lord.

2. Apostles, prophets, martyrs,
   A great and noble throng,
   This road that lies before us,
   In ages past have gone.
   They marked it with their footprints,
   With tears and pain and blood,
   Yet bravely struggled onward,
   Strong in the strength of God.

3. Began, continued, ﬁnished,
   The crown of life they won;
   Hark! as their voices call us,
   The race of life to run.
   Heed not the world’s allurements:
   We pass this way no more.
   Lay hold on life eternal:
   This life will soon be o’er.

4. Who saves his life shall lose it;
   Who loses it shall save
   To life that is eternal,
   Secure beyond the grave.
   With loins girt up and ready,
   With purpose ﬁrm and strong,
   We’ll tread where God’s true servants
   In ages past have gone.

1. God’s word is so pure and so precious to me;
   Its precepts I love and adore–
   A lamp to my feet and a light to my path,
   Till pilgrimage days are no more.

Chorus
	’Tis better than thousands of silver and gold,
	More precious than rubies can be,
	To sit at the feet of my Master divine
	And hear when He speaketh to me.

2. How peaceful and pleasant the ways of the Lord,
   When under the Saviour’s control;
   The word that He speaketh is spirit and life,
   Refreshing and sweet to my soul.

3. I hear and obey, and my soul is set free
   To follow my Saviour and King;
   I cherish His word deeply hid in my heart–
   Rejoicing, His praises I sing.

4. O Lord, let my heart in Thy statutes be sound;
   Thy law is my joy and delight;
   Incline now the heart of Thy servant, I pray,
   To ponder therein day and night.

   Those blest scenes of Galilee,
   O rejoice and be forever glad!
   “We have found Him– come and see!”

Chorus
	“We have found Him!– Joy of the Ages!”
	And our song with heaven’s gladness rings:
	“We have found the Christ of whom the prophets spake;
	We have found Him, King of kings.”

2. Ye who hunger for the living word,
   Ye who thirst for living springs,
   Come, each waiting heart with joy is stirred
   By the song the herald sings.

3. This same Christ who taught beside the sea
   Walks upon the earth today,
   And He comes in lowliness to thee,
   Templed still in mortal clay.

4. “We have found Him!” Bear the tidings far,
   Wheresoever men are found,

   Shall in light and peace abound.

31: Hasten to the Place of Refuge

1. Hasten to the place of refuge;
   Do not linger on the plain.
   If you hope to dwell with Jesus,
   You must needs be born again.
   Do not build your hope on theory:
   Righteous acts will not avail.
   Christ in you, the hope of glory,
   Is the Rock which cannot fail.

Chorus
	Heed the warning, come to Jesus:
	Of all friends He is the best.
	Do not grieve His Holy Spirit;
	Come, and He will give you rest.

2. Come and drink the living waters;
   Bread of life is free to all.
   Do not slight the invitation;
   Hearken to the Saviour’s call.
   Full salvation Jesus offers,
   Victory over self and sin.
   At the door of hope He’s waiting,
   There to bid you “Welcome in.”

3. Time is ever speeding onward;
   Here you cannot hope to stay.
   Death is ever drawing nearer,
   And the call you must obey.
   In His tender love and mercy,
   Jesus waits to lead you home;
   From His light and love and presence,
   Why will you in darkness roam?

32: We Love the Perfect Way

1. We love the perfect way of God,
   The lowly path the Saviour trod;
   Pilgrims and strangers here we roam:
   We’re travelling on to God and home.

Chorus
	In Jesus we have found the way
	Which leads to God and endless day;
	While here on earth He lends us breath,
	We will be true, be true till death.

2. We hear His voice and bless the hand
   That leads us through the desert land;
   We know the end is fair and sweet,
   Where we shall rest our weary feet.

3. Our God is merciful and kind:
   He found us lost in sin and blind,
   And gently led us to the light;
   Our song shall praise Him day and night.

4. His arm is strong: we do not fear,
   Though Satan’s host is ever near;
   He will protect us and defend
   And keep us faithful to the end.

   Throw your soul’s fresh, glowing ardour
   Into the battle for truth.
   Jesus has set the example:
   Dauntless was He, true and brave;
   Give Him your loyal devotion,
   Give Him the best that you have.

Chorus
	Give of your best to the Master,
	Give of the strength of your youth;
	Clad in salvation’s full armour,
	Join in the battle for truth.

2. Give of your best to the Master,
   Give Him ﬁrst place in your heart;
   Give Him ﬁrst place in your service;
   Consecrate every part.
   Give, and to you shall be given–
   God His belovèd Son gave;
   Gratefully seeking to serve Him,
   Give Him the best that you have.

3. Give of your best to the Master–
   Naught else is worthy His love;
   He gave Himself for your ransom,
   Gave up His glory above,
   Laid down His life without murmur,
   You from sin’s ruin to save;
   Give Him your heart’s adoration,
   Give Him the best that you have.

2. Teach us, Lord, our days to number–
   Brief, so brief, life’s longest span;
   Make us wise with heavenly wisdom,
   Doing good while yet we can.

3. Teach us, Lord, our days to number;
   Wake our souls to righteousness;
   Save us from things seen and temporal;

35: God’s Salvation

1. God has always laboured human lives to win
   To His path of life from varied ways of sin.
   This is what He offers; nothing else will do
   But the life of Jesus Christ lived out in you.

Chorus
	God’s salvation is the Christ within,
	Giving daily victory over sin:
	Him as Lord by lip and life confessed–
	Walking in His footsteps to eternal rest.

2. Some compare their lives with lives of other men
   And by moral actions hope God’s home to gain;
   Yet the best men living, unrenewed by God,
   Must be shut forever from that blest abode.

3. Friend, if you are honest, yield your life to God,
   Make the Christ your Master, choose the path He trod.

   “To guide my steps into the path of life?
   Is there no light? for I am growing weary

2. The Light of Life through Jesus still is shining,
   And unto you He says, “I am the Way.”
   O doubting soul, there is no need to wander:
   Turn unto Him– He will not let you stray.

3. He came to be a light to those in darkness,
   To all who have this vale of shadow trod.
   If you receive Him, He will be your Saviour
   And give you power to be a child of God.

4. A little while the Light of Life is with you;

2. Hear the prophets’ exhortation
   Given with a warning sound;

   Then weep and wail beyond the grave?”

Chorus
	’Tis not worthwhile, O count the cost:
	Why should thy precious soul be lost?
	God loves thee though by sin deﬁled;
	O turn to Him, be reconciled.

2. Is it worthwhile, for earth’s renown,
   To forfeit thine eternal crown?
   Earth’s honours fade, death comes to all;
   Is it worthwhile to spurn God’s call?

3. Though all thy friends should turn away

	His love and promises endure.

2. The love of God within my heart
   Will teach me how to do my part
   In serving Him from day to day
   And walking Jesus’ lowly way.

3. The costly garments He provides
   Are worn if we in Him abide;
   The world looks on and does despise

	Take the yoke of Jesus ever,

2. If thy heart be oft disquieted,

3. There is a way, a humble way,
   A way of truth and grace–

3. That voice that called, in accents clear,

48: Abundant Life

1. Under the burdens of guilt and care,
   Many a spirit is grieving,
   Who in the joy of the Lord might share,
   Life everlasting receiving.

Chorus
	Life! life! eternal life!
	Jesus alone is the giver!
	Life! life! abundant life!
	Glory to Jesus forever!

2. Burdened one, why will you longer bear
   Sorrows from which He releases?
   Open your heart and, rejoicing, share
   Life more abundant in Jesus.

3. Leaving the pleasures of sin behind,
   Making your choice for the Saviour,
   Turn to the source of eternal life,
   Love Him, and serve Him forever.

49: If All Things Were Mine

1. If all things were mine, but not the Saviour,
   Were my life worth living for a day?
   Could my yearning heart ﬁnd rest and comfort
   In the things that soon must pass away?
   If all things were mine, but not the Saviour,
   Would my life be worth the lifelong strife?
   Or all earthly joys e’en worth comparing
   For a moment with a Christ-ﬁlled life?

2. Had I wealth and love in fullest measure
   And a name revered both far and near,
   Yet no hope beyond, no harbour waiting,
   Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer–
   If all things were mine, but not the Saviour,
   Who endured the cross and died for me,
   Could then all the world afford a refuge,
   Whither in my anguish I could ﬂee?

3. Oh, what emptiness without the Saviour,
   Mid the sins and sorrows here below;
   And eternity– how dark without Him–
   Only night and tears and endless woe!
   What though I might live without a Saviour,
   When I come to die, what will it be?
   Oh, to face the valley’s gloom without Him,
   And without Him all eternity!

4. Oh, the joy of having all in Jesus!
   What a balm the broken heart to heal!
   Not a sin so great but He’ll forgive it,
   Not a sorrow but His love can feel!
   If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
   Nothing else in all the world beside,
   Oh, then, everything is mine in Jesus:
   For my needs and more He will provide!

50: Long My Eager Heart

1. Long my eager heart was yearning
   Some joy to ﬁnd.
   Ever on in sin I wandered–
   Poor, helpless, blind.
   Oh, to have the past forgiven,
   How I’d wrestled, prayed and striven!
   But the clouds remained unriven
   Till Jesus came.

2. Refuge I have found in Jesus–
   Sweet, tranquil rest:
   Blissful sense of preservation–
   Naught can molest.
   Sin and Satan’s host defying,
   On His strength and grace relying,
   With His every wish complying,
   Peace, peace is mine.

3. I have proved His power to save me
   From every snare.
   He is purer than the purest–
   Exceeding fair.
   He will nerve my faint endeavour;
   Naught of earth from Him can sever.
   I am His, and His forever!
   What joy divine!

   There is no place where earth’s failings

1. Sitting at the feet of Jesus
   With a broken, contrite heart,
   Listening to His word so precious:
   Joy to us it doth impart,
   Comfort gives in times of trial,
   Quickens every true desire,
   Fills our hearts with love like Jesus’,
   And with zeal it doth inspire;
   Fills our hearts with love like Jesus’,
   And with zeal it doth inspire.

2. This, the one thing needful daily,
   As we walk in Jesus’ way:
   Taking time to wait and listen,
   And to hear what He would say;
   Then with courage for the conﬂict,
   And with heart and mind renewed,
   Standing true and loyal to Jesus,
   All our foes will be subdued;
   Standing true and loyal to Jesus,
   All our foes will be subdued.

3. Let us choose then to obey Him
   And to humbly seek His face:
   He will ﬁll us with His Spirit
   And renew us by His grace;
   He will prove His presence with us,
   And His still, small voice we’ll hear.
   This, the source of all true blessing:
   When we know that He is near;
   This, the source of all true blessing:

72: Why Should I Walk?

1. Why should I walk in paths of night
   Which give no peace nor pure delight?
   My way is wrong, God’s way is right:
   His way is seen in Jesus.

Chorus
	The truth of God my heart has won;
	He’ll ﬁnish what He has begun;
	In earth or heaven there is none
	Who can compare with Jesus.

2. Man’s wisdom leads into a maze,
   And error grows in bypath ways;
   But hearts are ﬁlled with joy and praise,
   Who see the truth in Jesus.

3. My human power cannot avail;
   In war with sin it can but fail;
   By this alone I can prevail:
   Receiving life in Jesus.

4. Though sin assail me like a ﬂood,
   I’ll plead His name and precious blood;
   The pure and spotless Son of God
   And sinners’ friend is Jesus.

73: See the Saviour, in Compassion

1. See the Saviour, in compassion
   Come to earth to bleed and die;
   Think of His great love in leaving
   Heaven’s blessèd home on high,
   Down to win earth’s weary sinners,
   Wandering far: How can it be?
   Oh, what love– ’tis passing knowledge–
   Can it be? Can it be?
   Oh, what love– ’tis passing knowledge–
   Can it be? Can it be?

2. See the Saviour, thoughtful, walking
   By the Sea of Galilee;
   Hear Him call those lowly ﬁshers:
   “Follow me, come follow me;
   Come with me to live and labour
   Till the close of life’s last day;
   Help me win the souls who wander
   Far away, far away.
   Help me win the souls who wander
   Far away, far away.”

3. See the Saviour, kneeling, praying
   In the garden all alone,
   Facing death and cruel mocking–
   For our sins He must atone.
   Fainting neath a weight of sorrow,
   He must bear the cross alone;
   See Him patiently enduring,
   All alone, all alone.
   See Him patiently enduring,
   All alone, all alone.

Chorus
	Create in me more love for Thee;

	O help me show to all below

2. For His sake I chose the pilgrim way,
   Fixed my heart on things that are unseen,
   From the world’s allurements turned away;
   Now my heart He maketh pure and clean.

3. Oh, this Friend is mine while life doth last;

Chorus
	No eye to pity, no arm to save;

	For your transgressions died on the tree,
	Poured out His life’s blood, lost one, for thee.

2. God in His mercy, moved by His love,
   Sent the Redeemer down from above;
   He paid the ransom none other could,
   For your redemption shed His own blood.

83: In This World of Woe

1. In this world of woe and sighing,
   Broken hearts are seeking rest,
   Sick of sin and faint from crying,
   Longing to be healed and blest.
   God in pity sees your sorrow,
   Longs to give your heart relief;
   Don’t despise Him lest tomorrow
   Should for you mean endless grief.

Chorus
	With your heart you hear Him pleading;
	Don’t resist His gentle touch:
	You can safely trust His leading,
	And you need Him, oh! so much.

2. All your life you’ve sought for pleasure;
   Still your soul is ill at ease:
   Earth with all its gilded treasure
   Fails to satisfy or please.
   Every day some new illusion
   Seems to offer what you crave:
   Thus the author of confusion
   Leads men to a Christless grave.

3. Friend, just now your heart is tender:
   You have heard the Saviour’s call.
   Let Him be your soul’s defender;
   Yield Him now your life, your all.
   Eagerly the angels listen
   For the yes that sets you free;
   There where all His jewels glisten
   You may dwell eternally.

   And in losing a hundredfold gain;
   Then to fall in the earth I would choose
   And to die, thus God’s best to obtain.

3. Only one life, and white is the ﬁeld–
   With compassion this great need I view;
   So the one life I have I will yield,
   And the little I can I will do.

   If you miss His great salvation,
   Oh, what then will be your end?

95: God Calling Yet

1. God calling yet! Shall I not hear?
   Earth’s pleasures shall I still hold dear?
   Shall life’s swift passing years all ﬂy,
   And still my soul in slumber lie?

2. God calling yet! And shall He knock,
   And I my heart the closer lock?
   He still is waiting to come in,
   And shall I dare go on in sin?

3. God calling yet! And shall I give
   No heed, but still in bondage live?
   I wait, but He does not forsake;
   He calls me still; my heart, awake!

4. God calling yet! I cannot stay;
   My heart I yield without delay.
   Vain world, farewell, from thee I part;
   The voice of God has reached my heart.

96: Take Up Thy Cross

1. “Take up thy cross,” the Saviour said,
   “If thou wouldst my disciple be;
   Deny thyself, the world forsake,
   And humbly follow after me.”

2. Take up thy cross– let not its weight
   Fill thy weak spirit with alarm;
   His strength shall bear thy spirit up
   And brace thy heart and nerve thine arm.

3. Take up thy cross, nor heed the shame,
   Nor let thy foolish pride rebel;
   Thy Lord for thee the cross endured
   To save thy soul from death and hell.

4. Take up thy cross, then, in His strength,
   And calmly every danger brave;
   ’Twill guide thee to a better home
   And lead to victory o’er the grave.

97: We Are Fading

1. We are fading, too, like the ﬂowers
   That but yesterday were in their bloom;
   Oh, how many pass with the hours:
   O’er our path falls the shadow of the tomb.

Chorus
	We are passing: we shall never,
	Never tread this pilgrim way again.
	Oh! how sad to think of the many,
	Thoughtless, spending their precious lives in vain!

2. All our days go by like a shadow;
   Soon our feet must tread the vale of death.
   Joys of earth endure but a moment;
   Earthly hopes fail when fails the parting breath.

3. In the days of youth, O remember,
   Wasted years shall come again no more;
   With the tides of time we are drifting;
   Soon our footsteps shall reach another shore.

4. Through those sad, dark days, see the Saviour:
   ’Twas for us He trod that path of pain;
   Lone and weary, silent He suffered:
   Shall such love for your soul be all in vain?

98: Let Us Pause

1. Let us pause amid life’s pleasures,
   Midst its toils and tears;
   Hearken while the Master calleth
   Through our doubts and fears.

Chorus
	Time is ﬂeeting, ﬂowers are falling,
	Life will soon be past;
	Pause and ponder where thou goest:
	Time is ﬂying fast.

2. While we look on mirth and beauty,
   Pleasures bright today,
   Men are slipping far beyond us
   To the silent clay.

3. Borne along life’s rushing river,
   We are hastening on;
   Shall we hear when death shall take us,
   “Soul, thou hast well done!”

   Help our wavering choice;

   To Thy pleading voice.

99: Oh, What Shall It Proﬁt?

1. Life, only once we can live it–
   Oh, what a great solemn thought!
   Soon will our journey be over;
   Soon will the battle be fought.

Chorus
	Oh, what shall it profit,
	Riches and pleasures to gain?
	If your own soul is the forfeit,
	Shall it not all be in vain?

2. Life, as the ﬂowers that are blooming,
   Withers and passes away:
   All its great glory is ﬂeeting–
   Only the joy of a day.

3. If you are heavily laden,
   Tired of a life that is vain,
   Jesus has promised to save you
   If you will yield to His claim.

4. Will you now choose to obey Him,
   Yielding yourself to His call?
   This is the choice that will save you:
   Making Him Lord of your all.

100: Passing Onward

1. Passing onward, quickly passing;
   But, I ask thee, whither bound?
   Is it to the many mansions
   Where eternal rest is found?
   Passing onward, passing onward,
   Tell me, sinner, whither bound?

2. Passing onward, quickly passing;
   Naught the wheels of time can stay;
   Sweet the thought that some are going
   To the realms of perfect day,
   Passing onward, passing onward,
   Christ their leader, Christ their way.

3. Passing onward, quickly passing;
   Many on the downward road,
   Careless of their souls’ salvation,
   Heeding not the call of God:
   Passing onward, passing onward,
   Trampling on the Saviour’s blood.

4. Passing onward, quickly passing;
   Time its course will quickly run;
   Still we hear the fond entreaty
   Of the ever gracious One:
   “Come, and welcome, come, and welcome;
   ’Tis by me that life is won.”

101: Only One Life

1. Only one life, and oh, how soon ’tis over!
   Earth’s changing scenes appear, then fade away;
   In careless ease, and seeking selfish pleasures,
   So many waste their precious lives today.

2. Only one life– the journey soon is ended;
   But what shall be the end for you and me?
   Only one life– it is not ours to squander:
   Its priceless treasures all are lent to thee.

3. Only one life, a few short years of service–
   Christian, awake! no longer heedless be.
   The need is great, for souls around thee perish:
   Redeem the time, for God hath need of thee.

4. Only one life– ye servants of the Master,
   Keep toiling on, though stony be the way;
   The sunset side of life’s steep hill is leading
   To God and home and rest and endless day.

102: Life at Best Is Very Brief

1. Life at best is very brief,
   Like the falling of a leaf,
   Like the binding of a sheaf:
   Be in time.
   Fleeting days are telling fast
   That the die will soon be cast,
   And the fatal line be passed:
   Be in time.

Chorus
	Be in time, be in time;
	While the voice of Jesus calls you,
	Be in time.
	If in sin you longer wait,
	You may ﬁnd no open gate,
	And your cry be just too late–
	Be in time!

2. Fairest ﬂowers soon decay,
   Youth and beauty pass away,
   Oh, you have not long to stay:
   Be in time.
   While God’s Spirit bids you come,
   Sinner, do not longer roam,
   Lest you seal your hopeless doom:
   Be in time.

3. Time is gliding swiftly by,
   Death and judgment drawing nigh;
   To the arms of Jesus ﬂy:
   Be in time.
   Oh, I pray you count the cost,
   Ere the fatal line be crossed,
   And your soul forever lost:
   Be in time.

4. Sinner, heed the warning voice;
   Make the Lord your ﬁnal choice,
   Then all heaven will rejoice:
   Be in time.
   Come from darkness into light;
   Come, let Jesus make you right;
   Come and start for heaven tonight:
   Be in time.

103: Time Is Passing

1. Time is passing, oh, so quickly!
   Days and years glide swiftly by;
   Make the most of every moment,
   For thou very soon must die.
   Life’s short span will soon be over,
   Never to return again;
   Do not spend thy noble powers
   On earth’s worthless treasure vain.

Chorus
	Buy the gold undimmed, unchanging;
	Buy the spotless raiment white;
	Rich and clothed, with eyes anointed,
	Daily walk in God’s pure light.

2. Time is ever speeding onward,
   Naught can stay its rapid ﬂight;
   Soon the shadows slowly creeping
   Shall proclaim the coming night.
   O arise, be up and doing,
   Labour now while it is day,
   Seeking those eternal riches
   Moth and rust cannot decay.

3. God is anxious to conform thee
   To the image of His Son;
   Fear lest thou shouldst grieve His Spirit,
   Mar the work He has begun.
   God’s own precious truth is Jesus:
   Sit in silence at His feet;
   Learn of Him, the meek and lowly,
   Then thy soul-rest shall be sweet.

104: Life Passes Like a Dream

1. Life passes like a dream,
   But earnest is each day.
   Though we secure and safe may seem,
   Time carries us away.

Chorus
	Life is ﬂeeting fast;
	Time bears us away.
	Millions more this way have passed,
	But none are here to stay.

2. The cord of life may snap
   For young as well as old.
   By accident or some mishap,
   Oft fall the strong and bold.

3. Oh, should we careless be
   And slumber without fear,
   Closing our eyes to things we see
   And deaf to all we hear?

4. God doth in kindness try
   To rouse us every one;
   For time is earnest, passing by,
   And soon the end will come.

Chorus
	Life’s short day will soon be over;
	Then we’ll see the One we love–
	Fellowship divine forever
	In the Father’s home above.

2. When dark clouds your path o’ershadow,
   Look again to Calvary;
   God’s own Son so gladly suffered,
   Bled and died for you and me.

3. Could we chance to do tomorrow
   What the Lord has planned today?
   For we cannot buy nor borrow
   When this life has sped away.

4. On that day the books will open;
   Then we’ll know as we are known.
   Though on earth we walk together,
   We must face the Lord alone.

106: The Pages of Life

1. While the pages of life are turning
   And silently pass from our view,
   Let us pause at the feet of the Saviour
   For His counsel so loving and true.

Chorus
	If only we knew as when life is through,
	No one would weary His bidding to do;
	None would despise the heavenly prize
	Waiting for me and for you.

2. Every step is just one step nearer
   To the end of life’s journey for me:
   As I ponder this thought, I’m reminded
   We are bound for eternity.

3. In the valley of hesitation,
   Countless millions have lingered and died,
   When the cost seemed too great for salvation,
   And too lowly His way for their pride.

4. Every day is just one day nearer
   When the King in His beauty we’ll see;
   In His hand He is holding the sceptre,
   With a welcome for all who believe.

107: My Heart Was Sad

1. My heart was sad and weary–
   I had no rest within
   And wandered on in darkness,
   Still deeper into sin:
   Iniquity had bound me,
   And all was dark as night;
   In bitterness of spirit,
   I longed for peace and light.

Chorus
	I’m glad I met with Jesus–
	He bid my sins depart;
	He came with joy and gladness
	To dwell within my heart.

2. I sought earth’s fading treasures,
   Some lasting joy to gain;
   Its pleasures disappointed–
   I found them void and vain;
   Life seemed to be a failure:
   The joys it could impart
   Left but remorse and sadness
   And sorrow in my heart.

3. The darkness seemed to deepen;
   No light, no hope was nigh,
   When, lo! I heard the Saviour,
   Who then was passing by.
   In kindly tones He whispered,
   “O soul, I died for thee,
   And bore in my own body
   Thy sins upon the tree.”

1. It pays to serve Jesus– I speak from my heart;
   He’ll always be with us if we do our part.
   There’s naught in this wide world can pleasure afford;
   There’s peace and contentment in serving the Lord.

2. It pays to lay treasure where rust cannot harm,
   Secure in the heavens, no need for alarm,
   Where thieves cannot enter to plunder the store;
   In Jesus there’s safety now and evermore.

3. It pays to serve Jesus, to sacriﬁce all,
   To spend and be spent here, whatever befall,
   To live for the things that bring joy to the heart
   Of Jesus, our Saviour, as we do our part.

4. It pays to die daily, to let God control
   The life He has given, redeeming the soul;
   For soon we shall meet Him: then what shall it be?
   Oh, will we be ready our Saviour to see?

Chorus
	Now none but Christ can satisfy;
	None other name for me;
	There’s love and life and lasting joy,
	Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

2. I sighed for rest and happiness;
   I yearned for them, not Thee;
   But while I passed my Saviour by,
   His love laid hold on me.

3. I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
   But, ah! the waters failed!
   E’en as I stooped to drink they ﬂed,
   And still my thirst prevailed!

4. The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,
   But never wept for Thee,
   Till grace the sightless eyes received,

110: Afar From God

1. Afar from God, sin’s cruel blight
   Consumed my life away;
   Far, far I wandered in the night
   From home and light of day.

Chorus
	Jesus Himself in love drew nigh,
	Whispered, “I left my home on high,
	And ’twas for thee I came to die:
	O sinner, come to me.”

2. Crushed neath my load of sin, I wept
   And wondered, “Can it be,
   Poor and a captive, there is yet
   Pardon and hope for me?”

3. His kindly touch my soul then healed,
   And through a mist of tears
   His tender look deep love revealed,
   Dispelling all my fears.

4. In Him I ﬁnd abiding rest;
   He’s more than life to me.

   He shed His precious blood
   That you might be forgiven,
   Bringing you nigh to God.

Chorus
	Lay down your heavy burden,
	O weary, sinsick soul;
	Come to the Great Physician,
	And He will make you whole.

2. Come to your soul’s Redeemer;
   His holy life He gave
   That you might share His glory
   Beyond the cold, dark grave.
   Heed not the wily tempter,
   Who bids you fear and doubt;
   Come now and trust in Jesus–
   He will not cast you out.

3. Peace past all understanding
   Will ﬁll your heart and life;
   His joy and consolation
   Will banish sin and strife.
   His voice so sweet and tender,
   So full of love and grace,
   Entreats you, “Come, and welcome
   And ﬁnd a hiding place.”

4. The night of death is coming;
   Soon you must stand alone,
   Your sins still unforgiven,
   Before the great white throne.
   Do not reject the Saviour
   Until the die is cast,
   Your life’s short day is ended,
   And you are lost at last.

   I came to Jesus as I was–
   So weary, worn and sad;

   And He has made me glad.

2. I heard the voice of Jesus say,
   “Behold I freely give
   The living water– thirsty one,
   Stoop down and drink and live.”
   I came to Jesus, and I drank
   Of that life-giving stream;
   My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
   And now I live in Him.

3. I heard the voice of Jesus say,
   “I am this dark world’s light;
   Look unto me, thy morn shall rise
   And all thy day be bright.”
   I looked to Jesus, and I found
   In Him my Star, my Sun;

Chorus
	“Come home, come home,

2. Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading–

   Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,
   Mercies for you and for me?

3. Time is now ﬂeeting, the moments are passing–
   Passing from you and from me.
   Shadows are gathering, night is soon coming,

   I have heard their plaintive cry.”

Chorus
	“O my sheep, why wander
	In the path of danger?”
	Hear the gentle Shepherd calling,
	“I will bring thee home.”

2. “Far they scatter o’er the desert,
   In the wilderness they roam;
   I must hasten out to ﬁnd them
   And to bring them safely home.
   On my shoulders I will bear them
   And the lambs fold to my breast,
   And the feet that are so weary
   I will gently lead to rest.”

3. “They shall hear my voice and follow
   Out where verdant pastures grow,
   And at noonday I will guide them

1. In the distant land of famine,

   Oh! how bitter that awakening
   To my sin and shame and need!
   Dark and dreary all around me–
   Now no more by sin beguiled,
   I will go and seek my Father,
   Be a bondsman, not a child.

Chorus
	But within His home He led me,
	Brought me where the feast was spread,
	Made me eat with Him, my Father–
	Me, who begged for bondsman’s bread.

2. Yet a great way off He saw me,
   Ran to kiss me as I came;
   As I was, my Father loved me,
   Loved me in my sin and shame.
   Then in bitter grief I told Him
   Of the evil I had done:
   Sinned in scorn of Him, my Father,
   Was not meet to be His son.

3. But I knew not if He listened,
   For He spake not of my sin;
   He within His house would have me,
   Made me meet to enter in:
   From the riches of His glory
   Brought His costliest raiment forth,
   Brought the ring that sealed His purpose,
   Shoes to walk within His courts.

118: Ye Must Be Born Again

1. A ruler once came to Jesus by night,
   To ask Him the way of salvation and light;
   The Master made answer in words true and plain,
   “Ye must be born again.”

Chorus
	“Ye must be born again!
	Ye must be born again!
	I verily, verily say unto you–
	Ye must be born again!”

2. Ye children of men, attend to the word
   So solemnly uttered by Jesus, the Lord;
   And let not this message to you be in vain:
   “Ye must be born again.”

3. O ye who would enter the glorious rest
   And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest,
   The life everlasting if ye would obtain,
   “Ye must be born again.”

119: O Wanderers, Come to Jesus

1. O wanderers, come to Jesus;
   All other trust is vain.
   Your every hope must fail you,
   Unless you’re born again.
   You need the cleansing fountain
   To purge your heart within
   And purify your conscience
   From all the stains of sin.

2. You need to come to Jesus
   And ﬁnd in Him your rest,
   Conﬁding in His goodness,
   Reclining on His breast.
   You need the voice of Jesus
   To whisper “Go in peace,”
   To calm the inward tempest
   And bid the conﬂict cease.

3. You need the power of Jesus
   To keep you day by day,
   To guard amid temptations
   And be your strength and stay.
   You need the love of Jesus;
   You need this faithful Friend
   To cheer you and to bless you
   And guide you to the end.

4. Then will you come to Jesus
   In spite of fear and doubt?
   He’s waiting now to save you
   And will not cast you out.
   If but, in true repentance,
   Before the Lord you bow,
   He’ll give you free forgiveness
   And His salvation now.

120: While Your Mind Is Calm

1. While your mind is calm and quiet,
   Hear the Saviour’s still, small voice;
   He is anxious now to save you,
   And in patience waits your choice
   To surrender all unto Him,
   Keeping naught from His control;
   Such a heart-choice will bring gladness
   And His rest unto your soul.

2. As God’s Spirit seeks to draw you
   To His meek and lowly Son,
   Gladly take His yoke upon you,
   Learn of Him till life is done.
   Do not strive with your Creator!
   To resist Him means this cost:
   You will miss His great salvation
   And be numbered with the lost.

3. To reject or else accept Him–
   God gives everyone this choice;
   Well He knows the wise will serve Him,
   And His sheep will heed His voice.
   He will give them life eternal,
   Keep them, so they need not fall;
   Oh, what bliss to have salvation!
   Yield, friend, yield, lest you miss all.

121: The Saviour Is Calling

1. He is calling you home; will you hearken to Him?
   You are straying afar from the fold,
   To the river of death, with no hope in your heart–
   Its waters lie sullen and cold.

Chorus
	The Saviour is calling you home;
	A welcome is waiting you there.
	He laid down His life your soul to redeem
	And save you from hopeless despair.

2. There are dangers untold in the path you now tread,
   With no hope of escape for your soul;
   Then, O turn while you may, and give ear to His voice!
   Come under the Shepherd’s control.

3. He will lift all the gloom which is shrouding your life,
   Growing darker each step as you go;
   All the guilt of the past He will freely forgive;
   His inﬁnite love you will know.

4. To His comfort and rest, then, O hasten away!
   Lose no time, lest your soul should be lost.
   With no Christ in your heart, drifting on to your doom,
   O say, have you counted the cost?

   Oh! what will you do?
   Death! death is approaching;
   How sad is your plight!
   While Jesus is calling,
   O come, come tonight.

3. Heed not the delusion
   That some other day

   And God gives you light,

123: Thirsty Soul

1. Dost thou seek in life’s fair morning,
   Pleasures from the springs of earth?
   Is thy heart not weary, drinking
   Waters from the wells of mirth?
   Earthly joys have but their season
   And are mingled with much pain;
   Drink, O youth, of living water–
   Thou shalt never thirst again.

Chorus
	Thirsty soul, thy Saviour calls thee
	From earth’s pleasures that are vain;
	He will give thee living water–
	Thou shalt never thirst again.

2. Dost thou, as Samaria’s daughter,
   Wearily at heat of noon,
   Seek those waters that will fail thee,
   Leaving thee to thirst so soon?
   While the Lord, so kindly waiting,
   Tells of joys that are not vain,
   He will give thee living water–
   Thou shalt never thirst again.

3. In life’s evening midst the shadows,
   As the shades of night hang low,
   Dost thou seek, while time is ﬂeeting,
   Wells from which thou soon must go?
   Hark! the Saviour gently calls thee;
   Life eternal thou shalt gain;
   Hear Him whisper, “I will save thee”–
   Thou shalt never thirst again.

   Grant me the cleansing Thy blood doth impart.

   Shame and dishonour wait those who stray
   Far from the Saviour on ruin’s dark way,
   Far from the Saviour on ruin’s dark way.

3. Kindly entreating, hear Him once more;
   Soon you’ll be stranded on sin’s treacherous shore.
   Angels are waiting; do you not care
   That you are drifting to endless despair?
   That you are drifting to endless despair?

4. Kindly entreating “Come unto me.”

Chorus
	We are building day by day,

	Every victory won by grace
	Will be sure to ﬁnd its place
	In our building for eternity.

2. Every deed forms a part in this building of ours
   That is done in the name of the Lord;
   For the love that we show and the kindness we bestow,
   He has promised us a bright reward.

3. Then be watchful and wise, let the temple we rear

2. Are we building now on the solid rock

3. Are we building now on the drifting sand
   A house that can never the storm withstand?
   Sad will be our end if thus we build;
   At last with grief we will be ﬁlled.

1. Lord Jesus, teach me how to choose–
   A thousand choices bar my way;
   I see in each a destiny,
   So help me wisely choose, I pray.
   Thy choices all in youth were made,
   And everything that tempteth me,
   A hundredfold on Thee was laid;
   Why should I then not come to Thee?

Chorus
	Lord Jesus, teach me how to choose;
	Talk Thou with me these choices o’er.
	Then let me choose as I would choose
	When time and seasons are no more.

2. Lord Jesus, teach me how to choose,
   For I am but a little child
   Within a world of mystery,
   With death and darkness surging wild.
   The many standards earth has set,
   The joy it offers warily,
   Thou didst not touch; I’d be like Thee,
   O Noble Youth of Galilee.

3. Lord Jesus, teach me how to choose;
   I’m glad that Thou dost understand
   The struggle of the youthful heart,
   The snares that lie on every hand.
   And though I do not grasp it now,
   I’ll better know when life is done,
   Why Thou didst point the hardest path,
   Asked me the straitest course to run.

Chorus
	Oh! ’tis Jesus guides my footsteps;
	He has made my heart His home,

2. Though the garden lie before me,
   And the scornful judgment hall,
   Though the gloom of deepest midnight
   Settle round me like a pall,
   Darkness can affright me never:
   From Thy presence shadows ﬂee;
   And if Thou wilt guide me ever,
   Jesus, I’ll go through with Thee.

3. Though the earth may rock and tremble,
   Though the sun may hide its face,
   Though my foes be strong and ruthless,
   Still I dare to trust Thy grace.
   Though the cross my path o’ershadow,

1. The Saviour now is seeking
   To win you in your youth,
   From paths of sin, to worship Him
   In spirit and in truth.

Chorus
	O turn from sin to Jesus,
	And learn His will to do;
	Leave the world behind, and you will ﬁnd
	Christ all in all to you.

   Give Him an entrance wide
   Into your heart; think on His love:
   For you He bled and died.

3. The Saviour now is speaking;
   O heed His warning voice;
   It means eternal gain for you
   To make Him now your choice.

4. The Saviour now is passing;

   Your choice for right or wrong will stand
   Through all eternity.

   Open wide the door.

	While the lamp of life is burning
	And the heart of God is yearning,
	To His loving arms now turning,
	Give thy wandering o’er.

   Now the call of mercy heeding,
   Open wide the door.

3. To the gospel invitation,
   Close thy heart no more;
   To receive a full salvation,
   Open wide the door.

142: Do Not Resist

1. Do not resist the Spirit’s gentle voice;
   Jesus is waiting, make Him now your choice.
   Come and evermore rejoice,
   Safe in the kingdom of God.

Chorus
	How shall you escape if you wilfully remain
	Outside the kingdom of God?
	Hasten to obey, while the Spirit bids you come:
	Enter the kingdom of God.

2. Haste, haste away! the time is ﬂying fast;
   Wait not until your day of grace is past
   And you weep and wail at last,
   Outside the kingdom of God.

3. Why should you let your priceless soul be lost
   And then awake, too late to count the cost?–
   Where the gulf cannot be crossed,
   Outside the kingdom of God.

4. Heed now His voice while it is called today;
   Come in His own accepted time and way;
   From your heart you then can say,
   “Safe in the kingdom of God.”

143: One Day Too Late

1. There are many who say, “Are there few that be saved?”
   Unconcerned for their own precious life;
   As the multitudes roam in the darkness and gloom,
   They are lost mid the din and the strife.

Chorus
	One day too late, many will wait,
	Stand knocking outside at the gate;
	Jesus will say, “Depart ye away;
	The door is now shut– it’s too late.”

2. Do not linger or stay on the world’s broad highway,
   Do not wait for the many or few;
   Leave the pathway of sin, by the door enter in,
   While the Spirit is striving with you.

3. While He calls you, arise, and no longer despise;
   Do not triﬂe with Him, I implore;
   See, His heart yearns for you; say, oh, what will you do
   If He leaves you there outside the door?

4. There is coming a day when the Master will say,
   “Go! depart, ye are not of my ﬂock”;
   You will then weep and wail, but no tears will avail–
   ’Twill be useless then standing to knock.

144: Jesus Is Calling

1. Jesus is calling, calling earnestly;
   For your sake He suffered on the cruel tree,
   Gave Himself a ransom to redeem your soul
   From condemnation while the ages roll.

Chorus
	Jesus is calling; hear His heartfelt cry.
	Why will you perish? Oh! why will you die
	Outside the Kingdom, missing the goal?
	What shall it profit if you lose your soul?

2. Jesus is calling from earth’s pleasures vain;
   Wasting your talents, there is naught to gain,
   Nothing but sorrow and remorse of heart.
   From sin’s delusions why not now depart?

3. Jesus is calling; He may call no more.
   Strive then to enter ere He close the door.
   What a sad awakening should you ﬁnd, too late,
   Mercy has vanished, shut is heaven’s gate.

   My peace and sweet forgiveness
   Your troubled heart will know,

   Where living waters ﬂow.”

2. Your only hope is Jesus,

   For you must stand before Him
   On that great judgment day,
   When those of every nation
   Before Him will appear–
   All who despised His mercy,
   In awful guilt and fear.

3. How kind the heart of Jesus:
   His voice is calling still.
   Grieve not the Holy Spirit;
   Do not resist His will.

   Spent as a tale that’s told;
   Will you remain a stranger

   Jesus wants to lead you on to heaven and home;
   Come while He is pleading; do not faint nor fear.
   He will walk beside you and your spirit cheer.

Chorus
	“Oh! what might have been,” This will be your cry
	When, too late, you see Jesus has passed by.
	Long with you He pleaded, but you would not hear;
	Now He cannot help you, though you faint with fear.

2. God is calling! Wanderer, will you then refuse
   All His tender mercy and His love abuse?
   Grasp the hand He offers: think what it would mean,
   Left to mourn forever, “Oh, what might have been!”

3. God had almost won you when your friends drew near,
   “You shall lose our friendship,” whispered in your ear.
   With the ﬂesh conferring, soon your heart grew cold;
   Then you turned against Him and your birthright sold.

	Forgiving transgression and sin;
	He waits at the door of salvation,

2. O come, while the Saviour is waiting,
   And risk not a moment’s delay;
   The riches of earth are deceitful,
   Illusive and passing away.

3. O come, see the Saviour is passing–
   His mercy and love do not spurn.
   Resist not the voice of His Spirit;
   To you He may never return.

Chorus
	Will you now receive Him,

2. Drifting: no sure anchor,
   No strong arm to save.
   Rocks and shoals lie hidden
   Neath the restless wave.
   Let the heavenly Pilot
   Guide you o’er life’s main;
   Then His home eternal
   You will surely gain.

3. Flee to Him for refuge–
   Do not be afraid.
   Christ is the foundation
   God Himself has laid.

   Those who reach His kingdom
   Must be born again.

2. This weary world so full of sin
   Can offer naught but loss:
   Its empty joys, its foolish pride,
   False hopes that, like an ebbing tide,
   Recede to leave but dross.

3. Your life is but a ﬂickering ﬂame
   That fades to shine no more;
   Then with that great and countless band,
   Before His throne you, too, will stand
   On an eternal shore.

   Burdens so hard to bear;

	Lord, now take me and make me Thine own;

   Let not sin’s wiles thy precious soul deceive.

3. Only one step– let Jesus safely guide thee;
   Only one step– shrink not with faithless fear;
   Only one step– O soul! whate’er betide thee,
   Take now this step, while God and heaven are near.

4. Only one step– thy hand give to the Saviour;
   Only one step– thy soul feels God is nigh;
   Only one step– O soul! if thou dost waver,
   How sad thy lot, if thou shouldst hopeless die.

165: I Am Trusting Thee

1. I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
   Trusting only Thee!
   Trusting Thee for full salvation,
   Great and free.

2. I am trusting Thee for pardon–
   At Thy feet I bow–
   For Thy grace and tender mercy,
   Trusting now.

3. I am trusting Thee to guide me–
   Thou alone shalt lead,
   Every day and hour supplying
   All my need.

4. I am trusting Thee for power–
   Thine can never fail;
   Words which Thou Thyself shalt give me
   Must prevail.

5. I am trusting Thee, Lord Jesus;
   Never let me fall!
   I am trusting Thee forever,
   And for all.

166: Oh, What Will You Do?

1. Oh, what will you do with Jesus?
   The call comes low and sweet;
   And tenderly He bids you
   Your burdens lay at His feet.
   O soul, so sad and weary,
   That sweet voice speaks to thee:
   Then what will you do with Jesus?
   Oh, what shall the answer be?

Chorus
	What shall the answer be?
	What shall the answer be?
	What will you do with Jesus?
	Oh, what shall the answer be?

2. Oh, what will you do with Jesus?
   The call comes low and clear;
   The solemn words are sounding
   In every listening ear;
   Immortal life’s in the question,
   And joy through eternity:
   Then what will you do with Jesus?
   Oh, what shall the answer be?

3. Oh, think of the King of glory,
   From heaven to earth come down,
   His life so pure and holy,
   His death, His cross, His crown;
   Of His divine compassion,
   His sacriﬁce for thee:
   Then what will you do with Jesus?
   Oh, what shall the answer be?

167: Still Undecided

1. Still undecided, look to thine heart;
   Grieve not the Spirit, lest He depart;
   Why wilt thou longer wait?
   Come ere it be too late;
   Jesus, at mercy’s gate,
   Grace will impart.

2. Still undecided, slight not the voice
   Breathing so kindly, “Make me thy choice;
   Look at my hands and see
   I bore the nails for thee;
   I died to make thee free;
   Come and rejoice!”

3. Still undecided, time ﬂies apace;
   Jesus entreats thee– spurn not His grace;
   What if the word were passed,
   “This night shall be thy last,”
   Where would thy soul be cast,
   Where hide thy face?

   Heaven’s gate is now in sight–

2. Close to the Kingdom,
   Still dead in sin,
   Just on the threshold–
   Why not within?
   You have the choice to make;
   You have the step to take;
   Enter the open gate
   To walk with God.

3. Close to the Kingdom,
   What need of fear?

   He has a place for you,
   And love untold.

   I will follow Thee.

Chorus
	At Thy feet I fall,

2. For where Thou goest, I will follow after,
   And where Thou lodgest, I will lodge with Thee;

3. The God of heaven now will ﬁght my battle–

2. Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;
   Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
   Change and decay in all around I see;
   O Thou, who changest not, abide with me!

3. I need Thy presence every passing hour;

2. Break Thou the bread of life, O Lord, to me,

3. Open Thy word of truth, that I may see

   Then in sweet fellowship, walking with Thee,

   Oh, may Thy Light our secret faults expose!

2. Make known to us Thy leadings at this time–

   As they of old, Thy voice so plain and clear;
   Our spirits cheer.
   Oft have we failed to wait and seek Thy face;
   Oft have our hearts strayed from the lowly place.

3. Here we repent from all iniquity–
   Cleanse us today;
   We long to walk in fellowship with Thee,
   So thus we pray.
   Thou dost delight to put our wrongs aside,
   As from our hearts we purpose to abide.

4. The ﬁelds are white and honest hearts are waiting–

   As ahead we saw the test;
   But we know Thou dost behold our every tear.

   As we daily make the choice
   To deny ourselves and all Thy will obey.

   God reigns in majesty on high;
   His eyes behold His chosen ones;
   His ear is listening to their cry.

3. God will avenge His own elect,
   Whose prayers ascend both day and night;
   And out of weakness make them strong,
   And put their enemies to ﬂight.

4. The hosts of sin are marching on,
   And forth to death their captives lead;
   And these may perish if we cease
   To watch and pray and intercede.

5. Souls wander on outside the fold,
   And God looks down with pitying eye
   On harvest great and labourers few,
   While souls drift on in sin to die.

6. My brother, sister, walk with God,
   With perfect hearts, sincere and true,
   That souls now lost in sin may see
   The life of Christ revealed in you.

   Lift up thy heart to His abode,
   And seek His love to share.

   Acknowledge every good bestowed,
   And offer grateful praise.

   Trust in the Lord’s atoning blood,

188: Father, in Thy Mercy

1. Father, in Thy mercy
   Hearken to my prayer;
   Make Thy servant worthy
   Jesus’ name to bear.
   He is meek and lowly:
   These great gifts impart,
   That they may forever
   Dwell within my heart.

2. Mourning, poor in spirit–
   Cause Thy face to shine;
   Open wide Thy kingdom
   To this heart of mine;
   Thine the power and glory,
   Thine the grace I need,
   Loving, serving, sowing
   All my life as seed.

3. Father, at Thy footstool,
   This great truth I own:
   Those who fail in dying
   Must remain alone.
   Let the love of Jesus
   In my heart now reign,
   Bringing forth abundant
   Fruit that will remain.

4. Gracious Holy Father,
   Hear me from on high;
   Teach me, like my Master,
   How to fall and die;
   Naught from Him withholding–
   Naught I now retain–
   I shall bear His image
   When He comes to reign.

   Settled eternally sure;

	Our God shall help her right early;
	Lo, she shall never be moved;

	Reigning o’er all His beloved.

   God in the midst of her dwelleth;
   Our rock and fortress is He.

   Jesus hath claimed for His own.

191: Watch and Pray

1. Oh! how sweet the words of Jesus,
   As we journey on life’s way,
   And we walk the narrow pathway:
   We should always watch and pray.
   And though farther on we go
   And our God we learn to know,
   Still we fall before the foe
   If we do not watch and pray.

Chorus
	Watch and pray every day,
	Watch and pray every day,
	For the foe is always near–
	We have need to watch and pray.

2. When at times the sun is shining
   And our path is bright as day,
   We should take it as a warning
   That we need to watch and pray.
   For the foe is always near,
   Though we cannot see he’s here;
   But we have no need to fear
   If we only watch and pray.

3. In the times of deep depression
   We may ﬁnd there’s much to cheer;
   If we’re conscious of temptation,
   Still we need not faint nor fear.
   When we seek our Father’s face,
   He will grant the needed grace;
   We may ﬁnish in the race
   If we only watch and pray.

193: In the Garden

1. What can give us hope of triumph
   As we face the daily strife?
   Is it not in praying always,
   Keeping true in secret life?
   Jesus in that night of sorrow
   Wept and prayed for grace and power;
   Came an angel, strength imparting
   For that ﬁnal, trying hour.

Chorus
	In the garden, in the garden,
	Lies defeat or victory.
	Grant us, Lord, Thy keeping ever,
	To be found awake by Thee.

2. Think of others in the garden,
   Weary, waiting, watching there,
   Found of Him for sorrow sleeping
   In the secret place of prayer.
   He the lonely watch was keeping;
   He alone the price could pay.
   All of heaven was beholding
   As He bore our sins away.

3. We ourselves a watch are keeping
   In our own extremity,
   And our Father, too, will send us
   Help for our inﬁrmity.
   As we think of days before us,
   Ever as we journey on,
   Well we know whate’er the battle,
   With His help it shall be won.

210: Gently the Holy Spirit

1. Gently the Holy Spirit
   Whispers at break of day,
   Guiding my thoughts to Jesus,
   And prompting my heart to pray.
   Arise, my soul, and answer
   The tender, secret call,
   Lest earthly cares prevent me,
   And I in temptation fall.

2. Gently the Holy Spirit
   Reproves me of my sin,
   Guides me again to Jesus,
   Who died my poor soul to win.
   May there be true submission
   Within this heart of mine:
   Then, reconciled and broken,
   I learn of His love divine.

3. Gently the Holy Spirit
   Whispers at close of day,
   “Cast all thy cares on Jesus,
   Who careth for thee alway.”
   Be still, my soul, and, trusting
   In His undying love,
   Commit your all unto Him;
   Forever He reigns above!

211: My Saviour, How I Love Thy Name

1. My Saviour, how I love Thy name!
   And oh! how precious to my heart,
   The bond of love which makes us one
   And binds us nevermore to part!

Chorus
	My name is graven on His hands;
	His precious blood now speaks for me
	Within the Holiest of all,
	Before God’s face continually.

2. My Shepherd, since Thy life is mine,
   I rest in this: Thou shalt prevail
   O’er every foe, without, within;
   Thy love, all-conquering, cannot fail.

3. My Master, all my soul desires
   The grace to serve Thee faithfully,
   With reverence and with godly fear,
   In meek, unfeigned humility.

   In life, in death, deny me not;

212: God Sent His Well-Belovèd Son

1. God sent His well-belovèd Son
   Down from His home above;
   He came that we might understand
   The depth of His great love.
   He left His Father’s home on high,
   And for our sins He came to die.

2. That quenchless zeal consumed His life,
   To do His Father’s will,
   And satisfy His just demands,
   And righteousness fulﬁl.
   He ﬁnished all God’s heart had planned,
   And then sat down at God’s right hand.

3. His saints, though few, adore His name–
   Those by His Spirit sealed–
   And love the mysteries of grace,
   To His own babes revealed.
   And oh! what joy and endless bliss,
   To see His face in righteousness!

213: The Heart of God

1. The heart of God is always grieved
   Unless His chosen people pray
   And seek His all-sufﬁcient grace
   To keep them in the evil day.

2. Prayer is the strong, connecting link,
   The vital, quickening, heavenly ﬂame
   Which burns within the hearts of all
   Who live to honour His great name.

3. Effectual, fervent prayers shall bring
   God’s richest blessings from above;
   All prayer prevails with Him who reigns
   Forevermore in sovereign love.

4. Prayer moves the loving heart of God
   To grant these favours from on high:
   A wise and understanding heart,
   A clear, discerning, single eye.

214: If It Had Not Been the Lord

1. If it had not been the Lord
   Who had died my soul to save,
   Then a sad and Christless heart
   Would have found a hopeless grave.

2. If it had not been the Lord
   Who had brought me to His fold,
   Then a lost and dying sheep
   Would have perished in the cold.

3. If it had not been the Lord
   When the ruthless foe assailed,
   No defence would I have known–
   If my Lord had not prevailed.

4. It is only He can save;
   It is only He can keep.

   Take out the stony heart, take out the bitterness;
   Give me a gracious heart that’s full of tenderness,
   A heart that understands, that will not fret or pine;
   Give me a tender heart– a heart like Thine.

2. Give me a heart from sin set free,
   Unworthy though my life may be,
   And may Thy Spirit its temple ﬁll
   And teach me to obey Thy will.
   May I forget the wrong someone has done to me
   And show the tenderness of Christ on Calvary.
   Let tears of sorrow come and all my ways reﬁne;
   Give me a tender heart– a heart like Thine.

3. Give me a heart that knows no guile,
   A heart forgiving all the while,
   A heart that reaches to do a deed,
   And stoops to help a friend in need.
   I want to feel the pain my neighbours often know
   And lend a helping hand if he be friend or foe.
   I want to share the loss in every weal or woe
   And have a tender heart, where’er I go.

3. Home, friends are left; it seems so strange,
   A wandering life to lead:
   To most it seems a frenzied craze

   In temptations hard to bear.

3. God is faithful in conﬁrming
   Every promise to His own,
   And He keeps them from the evil
   As they cling to Him alone.

4. God is faithful, souls to welcome
   To His fellowship of love,
   Where there’s peace and love abounding
   Till they reach their home above.

233: My Saviour Bids Me Sing

1. My Saviour bids me sing His praise,
   Adore His wondrous works and ways;
   His life within, His love and peace,
   Inspire a song which cannot cease.

Chorus
	My Lord and I shall never part;
	He reigns supreme within my heart.
	With all the joyful saints above,
	I’ll praise the God whose name is Love.

2. He came from God the Father’s heart
   To take the guilty sinner’s part;
   Love paid the price none other could,
   For our redemption shed His blood.

3. Although a stranger in the land,
   I will obey my Lord’s command;
   In Him my restless heart is still,
   Resigned to His most holy will.

4. A pilgrim in the heavenly way,
   I trust Him in the evil day;
   Clothed in His armour, I shall stand,
   Protected by His mighty hand.

5. When life is over I shall dwell
   With Him my soul has loved so well,
   Clothed in His righteousness complete,
   To fall and worship at His feet.

235: From Lips of Babes

1. From lips of babes, Thy perfect praise
   Shall rise as incense to Thy throne;
   For he who humbly Christ obeys
   Doth speak with wisdom not his own.

2. From lips of babes, by Thy decree,
   Strength is ordained to still the foe;
   For so it seemeth good to Thee:
   I thank Thee Thou hast planned it so.

3. From lips of babes, O blessèd Lord,

236: My Heart O’erﬂows

1. My heart o’erﬂows with praise to God alway,
   For needed grace He gives me day by day,
   Which is sufﬁcient to enable me
   To ﬁght the battle, gain the victory.
   How restful is my heart when this I know:
   According to my need, He’ll grace bestow.

2. Midst ﬁery trials and when tempted sore,
   In tender care He points me to that door–
   The entrance of the quiet, secret place,
   Where I can wait before the throne of grace.
   While waiting there I’m cleansed from sin and fear,
   My strength renewed, the way made plain and clear.

3. As in this present, evil world I see
   So much that would deﬁle and hinder me,
   It surely causes me to cleave the more
   Unto the Lord, and have His grace in store,
   That in all things I may keep pure and clean,
   Still live for things this world has never seen.

4. I long to live so that my life will show
   How much it means such boundless grace to know,
   That every weary, fearful soul I meet,
   Who day by day is suffering from defeat,
   Might through his tears and sorrows see in me
   What he could share through grace so rich and free.

5. The One who knows the trials of each hour,
   Knows ﬂesh would fail, how much I need His power;
   What rest it brings my heart to hear Him say,
   “I’ll give you grace, no power my hand can stay.”
   What rest it brings my heart to hear Him say,
   “I’ll give you grace, no power my hand can stay.”

   That’s opened up to me;
   From darkness Thou hast shown me light,
   The dawn has broken after night;
   My heart responds to Thee,
   My heart responds to Thee.

2. My soul lifts up to Thee its praise,
   And thankful is my heart
   For all the blessings Thou hast given,
   For all the moments Thou hast striven
   To teach the better part,
   To teach the better part.

3. I know that I am sinful, Lord;
   My heart cries out to Thee
   To help me conquer self and sin
   And all that’s not like Thee within,
   So that my soul be free,
   So that my soul be free.

4. I long to walk the narrow way
   With heart and purpose free,

238: O Bless the Lord, My Soul

1. O bless the Lord, my soul!
   Let all within me join
   And aid my tongue to bless His name,
   Whose favours are divine.
   O bless the Lord, my soul,
   Nor let His mercies lie
   Forgotten in unthankfulness,
   And without praises die.

2. ’Tis He forgives thy sin;
   ’Tis He relieves thy pain;
   ’Tis He that heals thy sicknesses
   And makes thee young again.
   He ﬁlls the poor with good;
   He gives the sufferers rest;
   The Lord has judgments for the proud
   And justice for the oppressed.

3. God will not always chide,
   But when His strokes are felt,
   His strokes are fewer than our crimes
   And lighter than our guilt.
   High as the heavens are raised
   Above the ground we tread,
   So far the riches of His grace
   Our highest thoughts exceed.

4. The pity of the Lord
   To those that fear His name,
   Is such as tender parents feel:
   He knows our feeble frame.
   Our days are as the grass
   Or like the morning ﬂower:
   If one sharp blast sweep o’er the ﬁeld,

239: Our Hearts O’erﬂow

1. Lord, our hearts o’erﬂow with praises
   For the riches of Thy love,
   For this wondrous gospel story
   Sent to earth from heaven above;
   For that life of love so lowly,
   For the cross of Calvary,
   For the resurrection morning
   And our living hope in Thee.

2. For this fellowship so precious
   That unites us by Thy grace,
   Growing fuller, deeper, stronger,
   Sundered not by time nor space.
   Bind us closer, Lord, and closer:
   As one body may we be,
   And our love to one another
   Manifest our love for Thee.

3. In this world of doubt and darkness,
   Through us may the Light now shine,
   And our lives reﬂect a measure
   Of Thy boundless love divine.
   Teach us, Lord, to lift the burden
   Of the weary traveller’s load,
   And to journey on together,
   Ever on the homeward road.

4. So, through all our pilgrim journey
   Keep us faithful, Lord, we pray,
   Till, with trumpet loudly sounding,
   Breaks the dawn of endless day.

240: We Thank Thee, Lord, for Weary Days

1. We thank Thee, Lord, for weary days,
   When desert springs were dry,
   And ﬁrst we knew what depth of need
   Thy love could satisfy;
   Days when, beneath the desert sun,
   Along the toilsome road,
   O’er roughest ways we walked with One,
   That One, the Son of God.

2. We thank Thee for that rest in Him
   The weary only know–
   The perfect, wondrous sympathy
   We needs must learn below;
   The sweet companionship of One
   Who once the desert trod;
   The glorious fellowship with One
   Upon the throne of God.

3. The joy no desolations here
   Can reach or cloud or dim–
   The present Lord, the living God,
   And we alone with Him.
   When in the glory and the rest
   We joyfully adore,
   Remembering the desert way,
   We yet shall praise Him more.

4. Rememb’ring how, amid our toil,
   Our conﬂict and our sin,
   He brought the water for our thirst–
   It cost His blood to win;
   And now in perfect peace we go
   Along the way He trod,
   Still learning from all need below
   Depths of the heart of God.

241: The Truth of God

1. The truth of God so precious

   As with a contrite heart I walk
   With Jesus in the way;
   The lowly way which most despise,
   I glory now to tread;
   Anointed eyes see always
   Jesus ahead.

2. The path of life, I’ve found it
   In Jesus most complete;
   Though now cast out and suffering,
   His fellowship is sweet.
   He’s God’s own plan and pattern,
   The new and living way;
   My joy it is to follow
   With Him each day.

3. I’m glad He ever found me
   And came to dwell within,
   The stronger than the strong man,
   Who saves me now from sin;
   ’Twas life I got, not theory:
   His voice I did obey
   And entered in by Jesus,
   God’s only way.

4. Now I’ve a tender Shepherd
   Who leads to pastures new;
   His voice, it is my comfort,
   His hand, ’tis strong and true;
   I long to follow closer,
   Still nearer to His side:
   I never can forsake Him–

Chorus
	His smile as I journey brings peace to my soul;
	His touch makes me glad of His loving control;
	His love ﬁlls my heart with a hope strong and sure,
	And gives me a longing to keep my heart pure.

2. When we were yet helpless He saw our sad plight;
   As naked and wounded we groped for the light.
   His love pierced the gloom of our bitter distress,
   And into our souls came His gentle caress.

3. One night as He poured out His soul for the world,
   And legions of darkness against Him were hurled,
   He knew that His blood was the price and not gold,
   And offered His life for the lambs of His fold.

2. I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
   And here all day they rise;
   I seek the treasure of Thy love,
   And close at hand it lies.
   And a new song is in my mouth,
   To long-loved music set–
   Glory to Thee for all Thy grace

3. Glory to Thee for strength withheld,
   For want and weakness known,
   And the fear that sends me to Thyself

   I have a heritage of joy

   But the hand that bled to make it mine
   Is keeping it for me.

   Wake the soul to tuneful praise.

2. Sing to me when dawn’s ﬁrst wakening
   Brightens blooms all wet with dew;
   Tell in song of God’s great mercies,
   Which are every morning new;
   And when day has aged to noontide
   And the heart is pressed with care,
   Sing thy song of intercession
   That will call my soul to prayer.

3. Sing to me sweet songs of Zion
   When I see life’s evening star,
   And my barque is slowly drifting
   Out across time’s lonely bar;
   If perchance I may be fearing,
   Sweet will sound some blest refrain;
   Sing to me the songs of Zion,
   Let me hear them once again.

4. Sing the song of resurrection
   When the Lord Himself shall come,
   And the heart shall know not sorrow,
   For the pilgrim will be home.
   Then ten thousand thousand voices

	Oh! matchless love so pure, divine;
	My soul has found a sure retreat–
	The lowly Jesus now is mine.

2. His love has overpowered my heart,
   No longer I in sin repine;
   Secure from Satan’s ﬁery dart,
   On Jesus’ breast I now recline.
   I hear His kindly whispered word;
   With beauty rare His face doth shine;
   I feel the pressure of His hand,
   Assuring me that He is mine.

3. I’ll follow Him, the sinless One,
   And all His marvellous way adore,
   Until I stand complete in Him,
   His image bear forevermore.
   When life’s short journey here will end,
   And I at last shall reach the goal,
   What rapture to behold His face,
   While the eternal ages roll!

	I love my Shepherd true;

   And bid my sins depart.

   The love of God, so sweet to me,
   My tongue can never tell.

   Where Jesus’ feet have trod.

   His purpose to fulﬁl.

   But I know Thine eye watches from on high,
   And there’s grace for each step Thou’st planned.

Chorus
	Help me say, “Not my will, but Thine,”

	Lord, Thy power I need and for grace I plead,
	Just to say, “Not my will, but Thine.”

2. Lord, it’s not in me as I walk each day
   To direct my own steps aright:
   Keep me by Thy side, may Thy hand e’er guide,
   Lest I stray from the path of light.

3. Help me always be as a tender plant
   That would bend to Thine every touch.
   Lord, within me dwell; I would not rebel,
   For I need Thee, oh! so much.

1. I cannot see beyond the moment;
   Tomorrow’s strength comes not today;
   But, blessèd Lord, I trust Thy keeping
   For just the next step on my way.

Chorus
	O Jesus, keep my next step faithful
	To paths marked out by God for me;
	Hold Thou me up, O mighty Saviour:
	My strength and hope are all in Thee.

2. With each temptation Thou hast promised
   The grace to conquer and to bear–
   A way of sure escape provided
   From every subtle, secret snare.

3. Forgetting all the weary failures
   The sinful, selfish past has known,
   With eyes that look right onward alway,
   I will to follow Thee alone.

4. The storms that gather round my pathway
   May hide the next step from my sight,
   But faith can walk with God in darkness,
   And He will guide that step aright.

278: Oh! for the Peace

1. Oh! for the peace of a perfect trust,
   My loving God, in Thee:
   Unwavering faith that never doubts
   Thy choice is best for me.

2. Best, though my plans be set at naught;
   Best, though the way be rough;
   Best, though my earthly store be scant–
   In Thee I have enough.

3. Best, though my health and strength be gone,
   Though weary days be mine;
   Shut out from much that others have:
   Not my will, Lord, but Thine.

4. And e’en though disappointments come,
   They, too, are best for me,
   To wean me from this changing world
   And lead me nearer Thee.

5. Oh! for the peace of a perfect trust
   That looks away from all,
   Yet sees Thy hand in everything,
   In great events and small.

6. That hears Thy voice– a father’s voice–
   Directing for the best;
   Oh! for the peace of a perfect trust–
   A heart with Thee at rest.

279: Increase Our Faith

1. Increase our faith, belovèd Lord,
   Release the cords of doubt that bind:
   Grant us the vision that can see
   The blessèd purpose of Thy mind.

2. Increase our faith when Satan’s hosts
   Against our soul are strong arrayed;
   Place in our hands the shield of faith,
   That we may face them unafraid.

3. Increase our faith when fruitless seem
   The toiling hours o’er vale and hill;
   Teach our discouraged hearts to feel
   Thy kindly hand is leading still.

4. Increase our faith when o’er our hearts
   Sorrow and loss their vigil keep;
   Draw near and heal the aching wounds,
   Thou tender Shepherd of the sheep.

5. Increase our faith when, night at hand,
   Death would return our souls to Thee;
   Grant us the faith that understands
   Our only hope is Calvary.

280: How Sweet the Thought

1. How sweet the thought– my Father knows,
   And plans my path, its joys and woes;
   That for each test I needs must face,
   He freely gives sufﬁcient grace.

Chorus
	Kept by His power, how sweet to know
	His hand will guard from every foe,
	And that by faith I now can see
	The One who gave Himself for me.

2. With fears within and foes without,
   That saving grace I cannot doubt;
   For I have learned in days gone by
   That on His strength I can rely.

3. Whate’er the future days may bring,
   Yet to His promises I’ll cling,
   That as my all I daily yield,
   His Son in me will be revealed.

4. I long to learn while here below

   That when He calls me over there,
   More of His likeness I may bear.

281: I Need No Strength but Thine

1. I need no strength but Thine alone,
   Thou great Redeemer, from whose throne
   All grace in fullness ﬂows.
   In weakness, I can be made strong;
   In battle, sing the victor’s song,
   My trust in Thee repose.

2. The arm of ﬂesh dishonours Thee;
   And in its self-sufﬁciency,
   The foolish heart deceives;
   But he whose hope abides in Thee
   Is as the ever-watered tree,
   Clothed in both fruit and leaves.

3. I need no book but Thine own word,
   Nor can the thoughts of men afford
   A light to be my guide;
   For, Lord, Thy holy word of truth,
   A lamp to age, a light to youth,
   Forever will abide.

4. For who would turn to cisterns, Lord,
   And leave the fountain of Thy word,
   Where Christ is all in all?
   He is my life and righteousness,
   True wisdom and true holiness:
   With Him I shall not fall.

282: His Way Is Best

1. I listen to the Master’s word,
   And all my waking heart is stirred;
   Midst sin and strife I hear Him say,
   “I will return: keep watch and pray.”

Chorus
	His way is best; I follow on,
	Just where His bleeding feet have gone;
	My one desire, to worthy be
	And ﬁll the place prepared for me.

2. I ponder o’er those words again,
   That Christ is coming back to reign
   And claim His chosen, faithful bride,
   Who in His way and truth abide.

3. Though most despise God’s lowly way,
   Reject His love and go astray,
   Within my heart one purpose burns:
   To stand approved when He returns.

4. His love can fully satisfy,
   And needed grace He will supply
   To keep me in the heavenly race,
   Until I see Him face to face.

283: Strong in the Strength

1. Strong in the strength of gentleness, of meekness, faith and love,
   I take Thy hand in weakness and press on toward things above;
   The Morning Star will be my guide: its lustrous rays I see
   Shining along the highway, marking the path for me.

2. Strong, radiant light assuring, my hope is set in Thee;
   The gleam from off the mercy seat must always help me see
   The precious things Thou hast in store for yielded lives and true,
   Striving to serve the Master, doing what He would do.

3. Strong in the strength which He supplies, my storehouse is complete;
   I feast upon the living bread and drink the water sweet.
   My every need He doth supply, secure within the fold;
   His promises are ever sure: rare treasures manifold.

4. How do I prize my calling, since Christ hath made me free?
   The hand of time must test me as I journey out to sea.
   Mid surges of temptations wild and murmurs of self-will,
   Is the Master at the helm? Hear Him whisper “Peace, be still.”

   The wealth of heaven now is mine.

Chorus
	I never can forget the day
	I heard the Saviour kindly say,
	“If thou wouldst my disciple be,
	Take up thy cross and follow me.”

2. I never can forget the love
   That brought the Saviour from above,
   Amid earth’s multitudes to see
   And set His loving eyes on me.

3. He brought the heavens nigh to me,
   The will of God so plain to see;
   His simple truth, so sure and clear,
   Was sweetest music to my ear.

4. I never can forget the day
   I learned to walk in Jesus’ way;

   Brought fellowship and life anew.

1. Wait on the Lord with conﬁdence and patience;
   Wait in your weakness and in darkest hour.
   He will renew your strength and you will daily
   Prove for yourself how great His love and power.

2. Wait on the Lord when ﬁerce the battle rages
   ’Gainst foes that seek to hinder from within,
   Or foes without that would destroy and lure us
   From God’s control, to darkness and to sin.

3. Wait on the Lord in fruitfulness and victory
   Lest you should be exalted and deﬁled.
   Wait on the Lord that He may keep you humble,
   Always sincere and simple as a child.

4. Wait on the Lord, and trust in all His leadings;
   Ask now of Him, and let Him ask of you;
   Answer His prayers, and yours He’ll gladly answer;
   Be true to Him, to you He will be true.

5. Wait on the Lord, be of good cheer and courage;

   To Thee, my Prophet, Priest and King;
   Though small and mean the gift may be,
   ’Tis all I have to give to Thee,
   ’Tis all I have to give to Thee.

Chorus
	Accept, I pray,
	The life I give to Thee today;
	’Tis Thine, ’Tis Thine:
	Forever I my claim resign.

2. Thou, Lord, hast given Thy best for me:
   Thou didst not shrink from Calvary,
   But drank the bitter cup of woe,
   That God, Thy Father, I might know,
   That God, Thy Father, I might know.

3. All that I am henceforth shall be
   Used in the way that pleaseth Thee;
   I mean to lay all at Thy feet:
   Grant it may be a savour sweet,
   Grant it may be a savour sweet.

4. So use my life, O Lord, I pray,

   As one by one Thy lambs are found.

Chorus
	I will leave it all to Jesus,
	For I know He understands;

2. Human minds so often question
   What pertains to good or ill,
   But the answer is in Jesus:
   All is measured by His will.

3. Every day I look to Jesus–
   None so loving, true and kind;
   Earthly things so many cherish

1. O hearken, Lord; incline Thine ear unto me.
   In deep distress, O hear my needy cry,

2. In dark despair, there comes this reassurance:
   “You have not failed until you’ve failed to try.”
   And though I’ve fallen often in the struggle,
   I trust the Rock that higher is than I.

3. To human pride and every selfish passion,
   To stubborn will, O help me, Lord, to die;
   Deliver me from this cruel, cunning nature,
   To ﬁnd the Rock that higher is than I.

4. When sorrow comes, and grief is cast upon me,
   When I am moved to ask the reason why,
   Help me to say, “Lord, who am I to question
   The solid Rock that higher is than I?”

5. When I am tempted in some weaker moment,

   When storm-clouds my soul may appal;
   His strong, loving arms will enfold me;
   Attentive His ear when I call.

2. The eyes of my Saviour ne’er slumber:
   He sees every child of His fold;
   Though scattered afar, few in number,
   He guides them with love yet untold.
   In wilderness vast and so dreary
   Sweet manna fell down from on high,
   And for the souls thirsty and weary,
   Their strong Rock of Ages was nigh.

3. The heart of my Saviour is tender:
   He gave His own life for His sheep;
   To Him all I have I surrender–
   My life He is able to keep.
   I’ll follow my Saviour unfearing,

   His hand outstretched in mercy
   Corrects our wandering feet
   And draws through mists and shadows

2. How can we fear the future,
   When love has planned the way
   Which leads o’er hills and valleys
   To one eternal day?
   E’en death at last is conquered,
   The grave has lost its fear,
   And all faith sees is heaven
   Throw wide its portals here.

3. So, struggling soul, press onward,
   And keep the goal in view;
   What God has done in others,

Chorus
	God forbid that I should glory,
	Save in Jesus and His cross,

2. Earthly sufferings are not worthy
   Of a moment’s thought or care,
   When compared with all the glory
   Which I can with Jesus share.

3. Some consider earthly honour
   And in blindness turn away,
   Choosing rather Satan’s bypaths

   All the shame and world rejection

1. A life of overcoming,
   A life of ceaseless praise:
   Be this thy blessèd portion
   Throughout the coming days;
   The victory was purchased
   On Calvary’s cross for thee:
   Sin shall not have dominion,
   The Son has made thee free.

2. And wouldst thou know the secret
   Of constant victory?
   Let in the Overcomer,
   And He will conquer thee!
   Thy broken spirit, taken
   In sweet captivity,
   Shall glory in His triumph
   And share His victory.

3. Though all the path before thee
   The hosts of darkness ﬁll,
   Look to thy Father’s promise
   And claim the victory still;
   Faith sees the heavenly legions,
   Where doubt sees naught but foes,
   And through the very conﬂict
   Her life the stronger grows.

4. More stern will grow the conﬂict
   As nears our King’s return,
   And they alone can face it
   Who this great lesson learn:
   That from them God asks nothing,
   But to unlatch the door,
   Admitting Him who through them
   Will conquer evermore.

Chorus
	The tempest raged upon the angry deep.

2. Be of good cheer when storms around you rise,

   Our Father’s hand shall guide through storm and sea;

2. No cheering word can faith impart,
   With hope inspire my soul,
   Till by His voice it reach my heart
   To heal and make it whole.

3. No joyful song of praise have I,
   My lips no word of cheer
   Can give to those who needy cry,
   Until my Lord draws near.

4. My life a desert place would be,
   A wilderness so drear,
   Except my Lord, He whom I love,
   Doth every hour draw near.

301: Mid Worldly Temptations

1. Mid worldly temptations
   And trials severe,
   O lead us, Lord Jesus,
   And teach us Thy fear;
   Thou knowest our nature,
   So weak and so frail;
   O grant us Thy blessing,
   And strength to prevail.

Chorus
	Lord Jesus, guide we pray;
	Keep us in Thy pathway,
	And lead us alway.

2. O Saviour, we thank Thee
   For Thy precious life;
   O help us prove worthy
   To win in the strife.
   We know what it cost Thee
   To show us the way
   And suffer for sinners
   On dark Calvary.

3. We’re glad Thou didst tell us:
   If we faithful live,
   Our prize is more precious
   Than this world can give.
   Above with the Father,
   At heaven’s throne of grace,
   Is Christ interceding
   As we run the race.

302: Dear Saviour, Lead Me

1. Dear Saviour, lead me by Thy hand divine,
   Till my life’s close, O keep me ever Thine;
   I am a stranger in a hostile land
   And need the guidance of Thy loving hand.

Chorus
	Dear Saviour, keep me by Thy side,
	For my poor soul would always there abide;
	When Thou art very near, Thy presence gives me cheer;
	My soul shall know no fear when Thy hand doth guide.

2. Should sorrow’s dark night o’er my pathway spread
   Rough, stony places, where my feet shall tread,
   In tender mercy all for me is planned,
   That I might know the guidance of Thy hand.

   Close to Thee, close to Thee,
   Close to Thee, close to Thee;

304: Come, Brothers, On

1. Come, brothers, on and forward!
   With us the Father goes:
   He leads us and He guards us,
   Through thousands of our foes.
   The sweetness and the glory,
   The sunlight of His eyes,
   Make all the desert places
   To bloom as paradise.

2. Lo, through the pathless midnight
   The ﬁery pillar leads,
   And onward goes the Shepherd
   Before the ﬂock He feeds;
   Unquestioning, unfearing,
   The lambs may follow on
   In conﬁdence and quiet,
   Their eyes on Him alone.

3. O dare and suffer all things!
   Yet but a stretch of road,
   Then wondrous words of welcome,
   And then the face of God.
   The world, how small and empty–
   Our eyes have looked on Him;
   The mighty Sun has risen,
   The taper burneth dim.

4. We follow in His footsteps;
   What if our feet be torn?
   Where He has marked the pathway,
   All hail the brier and thorn!
   Scarce seen, scarce heard, unreckoned,
   Despised, defamed, unknown,
   Or heard, but by our singing–
   On, brothers! ever on!

305: Lo, We Can Tread

1. Lo, we can tread rejoicing
   The pilgrim’s narrow road;
   We know the voice that calls us,
   We know our faithful God.
   Come, brothers, on to glory!
   With every face set fast,
   On towards the golden towers,
   Where we shall rest at last.

2. It was with voice of singing
   We left the land of night,
   To pass, to glorious music,
   Far onward out of sight.
   O brothers, was it sorrow,
   Though thousand worlds were lost?
   Our eyes have looked on Jesus,
   And thus we count the cost.

3. Oh, bliss, to leave behind us
   The fetters of the slave!
   To leave ourselves behind us,
   The grave clothes and the grave!
   To speed, unburdened pilgrims,
   Glad, empty-handed, free,
   To cross the trackless deserts
   And walk upon the sea!

4. Across the will of nature
   Leads on the path of God!
   Not where the ﬂesh delighteth,
   The feet of Jesus trod.
   If now the path be narrow
   And steep and rough and lone,
   If crags and tangles cross it,
   Praise God! we will go on.

306: He Waits for Thee

1. He waits for thee, He waits for thee–
   O do not linger on the way;
   God longs a Father true to be;
   He’ll guide and help you day by day.

Chorus
	Fair are the prospects all ahead,
	And good the land He offers free;
	The One who all our fathers led
	Will lead thee through: He waits for thee.

2. Would you not seek what Abram had–
   The conscious guidance of God’s hand?
   As launching forth he knew not where,
   He went to seek the promised land.

3. Fear not the mountain’s rocky slope,
   Or e’en the valleys dark below–
   This is the path that leads to God;
   ’Tis sweet each day with Him to go.

4. Sweet is the story you shall tell
   At eventide, when day is done:

   Jesus is my strong tower and my rock of defence:

309: How Fresh and Green

1. How fresh and green the pastures fair
   Where the good Shepherd leads His sheep;
   The river of God’s pleasure there
   Flows on forever, still and deep;
   Afar from all the strife and gloom,
   He rests with all His ﬂock at noon.

Chorus
	The Shepherd and the sheep rejoice:
	How still and sweet those pastures fair;
	The desert blooms as paradise,
	For God is with His people there.

2. How sweet the fragrant vale of prayer
   Where Jesus loved to watch and pray;
   We love to trace His footprints there:
   No clouds obscure, no fears dismay;
   Our prayers and praise and songs of grace
   Like incense ﬁll the holy place.

3. From all the world, its toil and care,
   To watch with Him we turn aside;
   Our Shepherd true is waiting there,
   And every need will be supplied;
   He speaks, how pleasant is His voice!
   Our satiated hearts rejoice.

4. Made meet His sufferings here to share,
   Our heavenly gain is earthly loss;
   Content if Jesus leads us there,
   To labour now and bear the cross
   And manifest His life and name,
   To all the world His love proclaim.

   Gathering the lambs as they falter and fall,

311: Love Supreme

1. He found me in a desert land,
   A waste and howling wilderness;
   His loving heart was pained to see
   My lost estate, my helplessness;
   “Fear not,” said He, “thy Lord is nigh;
   No ransomed soul need ever die.”

Chorus
	Oh, love supreme! Oh, sovereign grace!
	Which brought my Saviour from on high
	To seek His sheep, and bring them home:
	Dear as the apple of God’s eye.

2. He soothed and bound my bleeding wounds
   And bore me gently to the fold;
   His tender care dispelled my fear
   And ﬁlled my soul with joy untold;
   Beloved of God forevermore,
   My days of banishment are o’er.

3. I pass my days in sweet content
   Within the chambers of the King;
   I hear His voice and see His face;
   His love inspires the song I sing,
   In harmony with heaven above–
   One spirit with the God I love.

   Where living waters ﬂow.

2. When wearied with the strife,
   My soul He doth restore;
   His loving-kindness woos my heart
   To love Him more and more.
   The path of righteousness
   With Him I gladly take.
   Why should I stray? He leads the way
   E’en for His own name’s sake.

3. To walk the vale of death
   Is sweet, with Jesus near;

   No evil will I fear.
   My table He prepares

3. How many subtle forms it takes

   Stretch forth Thine arm, my soul defend;
   Draw near and take my part,
   Draw near and take my part.

2. For, Lord, Thou art my hiding place
   When earth’s dark shadows fall;
   I lift mine eyes to seek Thy face
   And there behold such love and grace,
   Naught can my soul appal,
   Naught can my soul appal.

3. And when I call in my distress
   And for Thy mercy plead,
   Thou dost not leave me comfortless,
   But in Thy loving tenderness
   Dost meet my heart’s deep need,
   Dost meet my heart’s deep need.

1. Today is mine, tomorrow may not be.
   How brief this life, how long eternity!
   Swiftly and surely sands of time will run–
   Finished earth’s day, eternity begun.

2. The joys of earth– how soon they fade and die!
   In vain we seek our souls to satisfy;
   We search for peace, and ﬁnding naught but pain,
   Mirth takes its ﬂight– ’tis but remorse we gain.

3. Our daily source of peace is Christ alone,
   Dwelling within our hearts, upon the throne
   To reign as king, His righteous sceptre sway;
   “Thy will be done,” then from our hearts we say.

Chorus
	This blessèd rest, O Master, give to me,

2. Sweet is the rest in bearing of the cross:
   Death to a life that brings me only loss;
   But from this death a resurrection sure:
   A Christ-ﬁlled life, acceptable and pure.

3. Sweet is the rest when after weary toil,
   I do not glory in the battle’s spoil.
   The victor’s crown, all honours, let them be
   To Thee alone who gives the victory.

4. Sweet is the rest that comes at close of day,

   To be with Thee, the One whom I adore,
   And live with Thee and Thine forevermore.

	’Tis not in vain: oh, may our hearts retain

2. ’Tis not in vain to die indeed to sin

   This is the offering we will bring

3. ’Tis not in vain to labour on with love,

Chorus
	“I love my Master, I love my Master,”

   Hearts from doubting free and pure;
   Hearts not closed by wrong desires,

   Hearts both brave and ﬁlled with courage,
   As God’s men of old we see,

2. Hearts both true and faithful beating,
   Who for others’ needs do move;
   From all treachery retreating,
   Hearts aﬂame with heavenly love.
   Hearts for needy ever searching;
   Hearts controlled by Him alone;
   Who, though death and anguish facing,
   Pray, “Dear Lord, Thy will be done.”

3. Hearts with love for those who perish,
   Tender, warm, for rich and poor;
   Lukewarm hearts God cannot cherish
   In salvation’s holy war.
   Hearts, like Jesus’, yielded wholly,
   Counting all of earth but loss;
   Hearts that, with His, share, but gladly,
   Sorrow, suffering and the cross.

1. Help me, Lord, to be wholehearted
   Through this life’s short pilgrimage;
   May a true and faithful service
   All my ransomed powers engage.

Chorus
	Help me, Lord, to be wholehearted,
	Serving Thee with love and zeal,
	Pouring out my life like Jesus,
	Who did all Thy will reveal.

2. Help me, Lord, to be wholehearted,
   Daily yielding Thee my all
   As a sacriﬁce well-pleasing,
   Till I reach my heavenly goal.

3. Help me, Lord, to be wholehearted,
   Heark’ning to Thy voice alway,
   That I might in turn re-echo
   Words of life to those astray.

   But a true, wholehearted service
   Unto Thee, my Lord and King.

323: Youth

1. Dear Lord, we thank Thee for our youth today
   Who know such love for Thy great truth and way,
   They close their eyes to earth’s corrupting charms,
   Choosing instead Thine everlasting arms.

Chorus
	Dear Saviour, keep them hour by hour
	Within the circle of Thy wondrous power,
	Doing each thoughtful deed,
	Meeting each Kingdom need,
	Sowing their lives as seed, to live evermore.

2. When ﬂesh would rise like giants in their strength,
   Defying truth and boasting at great length,
   Destroying faith, discouraging the heart,
   Defend Thine own, draw near and take their part.

3. When Satan, whispering with his subtle voice,
   Tempts them to be untrue to heaven’s choice,
   Grant them the wisdom to avoid his snares;
   Help them to know their heavenly Father cares.

   When on earth, as Saviour trod.

Chorus
	Live for others every day:
	Be a blessing while you may,

	Jesus-like in all you do.

2. Live for others, for that One,
   Who though God’s belovèd Son,
   Yet for others lived and died,
   And is crowned, the Cruciﬁed.

3. Live for others, spend, be spent:
   ’Tis the life the Master meant–
   Giving with a lavish hand,
   Meeting ever love’s demand.

4. Live for others, and when death
   Shall cut short life’s latest breath,
   You with joy shall meet the Lord
   And receive a full reward.

325: Not Unto Men I Labour

1. Not unto men I labour,
   Not unto men I pray,
   But in Thy sight, Lord Jesus,
   I walk the lowly way;
   And unto mine own Master,
   I either stand or fall:
   What men have said about me–
   That will not count at all.

Chorus
	My service is unto Thee, to Thee,
	My service is unto Thee;
	Through sorrow or pain, through loss or gain,
	My service is unto Thee.

2. Lord, may my steps be ordered
   By Thine indwelling love,
   True to Thy life’s example,
   True to Thy will above;
   Though I may walk in shadow
   Or in the noonday light,
   Let me know rest of spirit
   Through living in Thy sight.

3. I know the heart is sinful–
   None dareth trust his own;
   ’Tis not in man that walketh
   To guide his steps alone.
   He only doth walk wisely,
   Can be assured of right,
   Who, with his eyes on Jesus,
   Is walking in the light.

   And darkness gathers o’er my way,
   I look above and trust in Him
   Who ever leads me night and day.

2. When gloomy fears possess my heart,
   I seek the shelter of His breast;
   Where all is peace and joy and light,
   In conﬁdence I calmly rest.

3. What full provision God has made
   For those who daily seek His care;
   The pure in heart shall see His face,
   His ear is open to their prayer.

4. The race is not unto the swift,
   The strong no glories ever win;
   The secret of all victory is
   Obedience to the Christ within.

5. Then, fainting not, I press along
   The path where He has gone before,
   The blood-stained path which leads to God,
   To heaven and home forevermore.

2. Bind me in Thy yoke, Lord Jesus;
   Only thus can I go on:

   For my heart to Thee is won.

3. Bind me in Thy yoke, Lord Jesus,
   Step by step to walk with Thee;

4. Bind me in Thy yoke, Lord Jesus;
   Other yoke would heavy be.
   Selfish freedoms are but bondage;

2. Go, labour on, ’tis not for naught;
   Thy earthly loss is heavenly gain;
   Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;

3. Men die in darkness at thy side,
   Without a hope to cheer the tomb;

   The path is steep, and it is ﬁlled with fear:

   Loose not thine hold.
   Consider Him; His heart knows all thy fears:
   Loose not thine hold.
   Though all is dark, and hope and friends are gone,
   No ray of light, yet thou must still cling on.

3. O soul, be brave– no price too great to pay:
   Loose not thine hold.
   For there will come the breaking of the day:
   Loose not thine hold.
   Our life, at best, a few short years will tell;
   Hold fast– to fail, for thee means death and hell.

4. When life seems bright, and all is well with thee,
   Loose not thine hold.

Chorus
	To ﬁnish with honour the work we’ve begun,

2. It helps us to know as we ﬁght the good ﬁght,

   That Christ intercedes now by day and by night
   For the souls who keep steady and true.

3. There’s constant renewing for all who will pray;
   There’s balm for each wound and relief for dismay;
   For wisdom and grace are bestowed every day
   On the souls who keep steady and true.

4. If, true to our calling, we face the world’s frown,

   To His patient, loyal bearers of the cross.

Chorus

	Art thou pained to see His kingdom suffer loss?
	Throw thy soul into the conﬂict; do thy faithful, honest part,
	As a patient, loyal bearer of the cross.

2. Ages have not dimmed the record of the souls who did their best–
   Toiling, praying, sacriﬁcing, bravely meeting every test.
   And we have their simple message, though they’ve entered into rest–
   God’s own patient, loyal bearers of the cross.

3. We can ﬁnd these souls of greatness where the walls are weak and low,

2. I would be true for there are those who trust me,

   O help me, Lord, that I may never fail them,
   But, for the truth, fear not to take my stand.

3. I would be true because of those who trust me,

   For if some day they long to know the Saviour,
   Oh, may they ﬁnd the way to heaven and home.

	Never let your courage falter;

   There’s no promise God has given
   But He will fulﬁl;
   So, with unfeigned faith and patience
   Let us do His will.

3. Never let your eyes look backward

   Ever keep your face set forward

   Though at times the goal seems distant,
   Very far away,
   Soon will pass the light afﬂiction,
   Soon come endless day.

4. Never let your hands be idle:

   That I am not mine own.

2. I love to feel Thy presence near,
   Dispelling all my doubt and fear,
   To hear Thy voice within my soul,
   Inspiring me to reach the goal,
   Imparting words of cheer.

3. O Guardian of my soul so nigh,
   Each passing hour stay Thou nearby;
   Night shades may settle o’er my way–
   With Thee I do not fear the fray
   Nor dread the battle cry.

4. How sweet Thy gentle touch divine,
   Upon Thy bosom to recline,
   To taste the joys of heaven above,
   Abide each day within Thy love;
   Dear Saviour, I am Thine.

345: I Will Journey All the Way

1. I will journey all the way with my Redeemer;
   In love He sought and found me when astray;
   He blotted out my guilty past forever
   And placed my feet within the narrow way.

Chorus
	There’s no other friend to me like my Redeemer;
	I will journey on with Him unto the end.
	There is naught in heaven or earth can separate me
	From Him who is my everlasting friend.

2. I will journey all the way with my Redeemer;
   There is no friend with Him that can compare;
   For me He laid aside His Father’s glory,
   That I with Him eternal joys might share.

3. I will journey all the way with my Redeemer;
   He loves me with a pure, unchanging love;
   His righteousness and grace will make me worthy
   To share with Him the Father’s home above.

4. I will journey all the way with my Redeemer,
   Though others turn aside, their Lord betray.
   His beauty far outshines their earthly treasure;
   His love will bear me on till close of day.

   I cannot now go back.

Chorus
	I cannot now go back,
	I cannot now go back.
	Thou, Lord, hast heard the vows I made;

2. I follow at my Saviour’s call;
   My ﬁrst and best, I yield it all
   And give my talents great or small;

3. I long to live for Him alone:
   My life is His, my heart His throne.
   Why should I rob Him of His own?

347: Once We Were Wandering

1. Once we were wandering far from God
   And destitute of hope in Him;
   We came to Him, He shed abroad
   A living, lasting hope within.

Chorus
	Our hope and conﬁdence today
	Are deeply rooted in the Lord;
	He’ll guide us safely all the way
	And bless, according to His word.

2. Since ﬁrst we learned to hope in Him,
   We’ve proved His wisdom, love and grace,
   Enabling us to conquer sin,
   Which once controlled, and hid His face.

3. Today increasing tests we face,
   And some may fail to ﬁrmly stand,
   But all can ﬁnd sufﬁcient grace
   From Him: He saves with mighty hand.

   That we might be set free from sin.

348: Seeking for a Better Country

1. Seeking for a better country,
   Pilgrims, we are marching on;
   God is calling, we will follow
   Where the Master’s feet have gone.
   Called of God to follow Jesus
   And His footsteps daily trace–
   Love divine, so pure and changeless,
   Speeds us on to run the race.

2. Oft the desert way is dreary,
   But our hearts rejoice to know
   Jesus leads, He knows the pathway;
   Joyfully with Him we go.
   We must share in His rejection,
   Daily face the battle’s strife;
   Fellowship with Him in suffering
   Brings the resurrection life.

3. We shall bear our Master’s image:
   Let this thought possess our soul,
   All our life, at His disposal,
   Onward pressing to the goal.
   Suffering must precede the glory,
   But we know His will is best;
   After toil and tribulation,
   Comes the joy of home and rest.

349: My Pilgrim Way

1. Dear Lord, when o’er my pilgrim way
   The darkened clouds hang low,
   There stands reﬂected in the rain
   Thy promise in the bow.
   And so, within this heart of mine,
   Although I may not see,
   I know that there behind the clouds
   Is One who cares for me.

2. And though my heart be weary, worn,
   And though the way be long,
   Still I may journey on with Thee
   And sing the victor’s song.
   For Thou, my Lord and Saviour true,
   Dost hear my faintest sigh,
   And all the riches of Thy grace
   My every need supply.

3. Though Satan often may assail,
   Though failure I may meet,
   And sometimes in my heart I hear
   The whispers of defeat,
   Still I will journey on with Thee,
   My hand held safe in Thine;
   For nothing, Lord, can separate
   From Thy great love divine.

4. And so along this homeward road
   I know that Thou wilt guide,
   And future days shall hold no fear
   If Thou art by my side,
   Until one day with boundless joy,
   Thy wondrous face I see:
   My blessèd, risen, living Lord,
   Who died on Calvary.

   And hope lends her strength to thy soul,
   When victory is thine, and the Lord is near,
   And clearer thou seest the goal,

Chorus
	Just cling to the hand of God’s dear Son

	And mark the path till the journey’s done
	With pure and Christ-like deeds.

2. When pained is thine heart, and the clouds hang low,

   When tear-dimmed thine eyes as the seed you sow,
   And all thou canst see is defeat,

3. Thy struggle will end at the dawn of day,

351: God in Heaven

1. God in heaven has a treasure,
   Riches none may count or tell,
   Has a deep, eternal pleasure:
   Christ, the Son He loves so well.
   God has here on earth a treasure–
   None but He its price may know–
   Deep, unfathomable pleasure:
   Christ revealed in saints below.

2. Thus, through earthen vessels only,
   Shining forth in ceaseless grace,
   Reaching weary hearts and lonely,
   Beams the light of Jesus’ face–
   Vessels worthless, broken, bearing
   Through the hungry ages on,
   Riches given with hand unsparing:
   God’s great gift, His precious Son.

3. Thus, though worn and tried and tempted,
   Glorious calling, saint, is thine;
   Let the Lord but ﬁnd thee emptied,
   To be ﬁlled with love divine.
   Vessels of the world’s despising,
   Vessels weak and poor and base,
   Bearing wealth, God’s heart is prizing:
   Glory from Christ’s blessèd face.

4. Oh, to be but emptier, lowlier,
   Meek, unnoticed and unknown,
   And to God a vessel holier,
   Filled with Christ and Christ alone;
   Naught of earth to cloud the glory,
   Naught of self the light to dim,
   Telling forth His wondrous story:
   Emptied– to be ﬁlled with Him.

   My heart would be true to that purpose,
   Whatever may cross o’er my way.

Chorus
	I have spoken the word of surrender;
	My Lord has the covenant sealed.

2. I’ve vowed to be true to the Saviour,

   To Him I will cling through the shadows,
   With Him pass death’s vale at the end.

1. ’Tis not in vain the foe to face,
   The narrow way of life to take,
   To victors be o’er self and sin,
   Spend and be spent for Christ’s dear sake;
   To face the lonely days and years,
   Strong in the strength which He can give;
   From corn of wheat learn how to die,
   That Christ again in us may live.

2. ’Tis not in vain to learn to pray,
   To honour Him though others sneer,
   To do His will from day to day,
   For then we feel His presence near.
   E’en though the path lies dark ahead–
   We cannot see His blessèd face–
   Constrained by love, we follow on
   And trust Him where we cannot trace.

3. ’Tis not in vain: those gone before
   Who died in faith, this truth have proved;
   They fought the battle to the last,
   Sufﬁcient found His grace and love.
   ’Tis not in vain, we, too, shall know,

   When Christ, before His Father’s face,
   Shall call and claim us as His own.

   And all that He has done,
   It ﬁlls my heart with longing,
   While in this world below,

Chorus
	I will henceforth seek to live for Jesus;
	Help me, Lord, a witness true to be.
	May my daily walk and words and actions
	Prove to all that Jesus lives in me.

2. I know the path is thorny
   That Jesus trod down here,
   The lowly Man of Sorrows,
   Who faced earth’s scorn and sneer;
   It calls for self-denial
   And bearing of the cross;
   To be a true disciple
   Means earthly pain and loss.

3. My heart shall be His temple,
   And as He dwells within,
   He’ll keep me pure and spotless,
   Though compassed round with sin.
   My members all, if yielded,
   He’ll use in His employ:

   Fills all my heart with joy.

   As tests and trials abound,
   Among the wise or foolish,
   Oh, where shall we be found?

Chorus
	Rise, trim your lamps, be ready;
	Dark night will soon be past.
	The Bridegroom must be nearing;
	Hold fast, till then hold fast.

2. As shades of night encircle,
   Has faith given way to fear?
   Or through the darkness gleaming,
   Does hope our spirits cheer?
   Some by our side are sleeping,
   Have loosed their precious hold;
   Iniquity’s abounding;
   Shall our love, too, grow cold?

3. Though others may prove faithless,
   Keep true, ’tis not in vain;

367: Hold Fast

1. Hold fast thy conﬁdence;
   Lay not thine armour down.
   Let neither moth nor rust destroy,
   And no man take thy crown.
   Hold fast eternal life;
   His promises are true.
   If we will ﬁrm and steadfast stand,
   With strength He will renew.

Chorus
	Hold fast, hold fast to what thou hast attained;
	Lay not thine armour down.
	Hold fast, and be thou faithful unto death;
	Let no man take thy crown.

2. Stand fast when tested sore,
   Though keener grows the ﬁght;
   Thy Leader true has gone before:
   Stand by His Spirit’s might.
   Our comrades have been tried
   And constant hardships met;
   Our God can ne’er unrighteous be
   Our labour to forget.

3. Steadfast in heart and mind,
   Come, let us follow on;
   Fear not the foe; take courage new,
   Till victory is won.
   Thy Saviour’s name hold fast;
   Ne’er shun the cross or pain.
   Have conﬁdence and hope in God:
   Enduring, we shall reign.

368: I Am Satisﬁed Indeed

1. Once I wandered on in darkness,
   Knowing naught of Jesus’ care,
   Till I heard the glorious message;
   Now heaven’s peace and joy I share.

Chorus
	Satisﬁed, satisﬁed,
	I am satisﬁed indeed.
	Now His Spirit gently leads me,
	And He meets my heart’s deep need.

2. I have given Him the lordship
   Of my heart and life for aye;
   Naught from Him my soul can sever–
   He’s my Life, my Truth, my Way.

3. I have proved His saving power,
   And I know He’ll always be
   True and faithful, never changing,
   Giving life and liberty.

4. I am satisﬁed in Jesus,
   From the chains of sin set free;
   And each day I long to follow
   Him who gave His life for me.

1. Where others conquered we can win;
   As others fought we, too, can ﬁght.
   All enemies, the host of sin,
   We, by God’s power, can put to ﬂight.

2. God’s armour waits for us to wear:
   The shield and breastplate are at hand.
   No dart can harm: we’re in His care
   And able in His strength to stand.

3. New hope springs up; we stronger grow,
   For brothers, sisters in the past
   Have bravely faced the ﬁercest foe
   And pressed the battle to the last.

   We will in Christ our Lord abide
   And spread His glorious name afar.

Chorus
	No foes can reach that secret place
	Where hides my soul safe in His care;

   I know the Lord of Hosts is near.

   With hosts of sin by Satan led,
   The God of Truth will favour me
   And bruise the ﬁery serpent’s head.

   Keep on pursuing; His arm will prevail.

Chorus
	Faint, yet pursuing, own no defeat;
	Faint, yet pursuing, never retreat.
	Jesus is anxiously watching the fray:
	Keep on pursuing till close of the day.

2. Be ye immovable facing the foe–
   Courage and wisdom the Lord will bestow.
   War a good warfare, and cease not to ﬁght,
   Strong in the Lord and the power of His might,
   Strong in the Lord and the power of His might.

3. Be ye immovable, quit not the ﬁeld–

   To live our days on earth as days in heaven,
   To hear the Saviour say at last “Well done.”

Chorus
	Be true and faithful: His mercy’s sure,

2. How real to bear the cross and follow Jesus,
   To share a little of His shame down here:
   Misunderstood, rejected like the Master,
   Like Him a stranger with the worldling’s sneer.

   He overcame, now pleads for us in glory;
   O help us, Lord, to love Thee more and more.

   “Are my heart and purpose true?”

3. Oh, for faith to help me walk aright,
   Hope to point my vision to the light,

382: A Broken, Contrite Heart

1. A broken and a contrite heart
   Our God will not despise;
   He longs to be our strength and shield,
   To counsel and advise.
   A contrite spirit is the price
   To keep His storehouse open;
   When we’re worthy He delights
   To help and sympathize.

2. The race was never to the swift,
   Nor battle to the strong;
   The patient, frail, uncomely Man
   Prevailed when all went wrong;
   He fought each battle on His knees
   And took each victory calmly,
   Lived and died a sacriﬁce,
   Rejected by the throng.

3. There’s victory for the ones alone
   Who keep the faith like Paul,
   Who walk with God and hear His voice
   And heed His every call,
   Who keep their garments clean and white,
   Though comrades fall and waver;
   Such will cheer the heart of God
   And be a help to all.

   He knows the trials and temptations,
   And bids us seek His face alone
   For grace to overcome and live a life

2. His care can soften all our hardness,
   Relieve when all seems dark and vain,
   And ﬁll our hearts with deeper purpose
   To glorify His precious name.
   How much He’s grieved if we’re not proving
   His voice and presence always near;
   So let us ever seek to prove His wondrous care,
   always count it dear.

3. He leads us, and by faith we follow,
   With hearts united to His will;
   His heart will plan, His hand deliver
   And show to us He’s leading still.
   How much we see in Him to cheer us,
   To keep us in the evil day;

   Now He reigns upon the throne.
   See the cruel shame He suffered
   All alone on Calvary’s tree,
   Yet His ardour ne’er diminished,
   Even in Gethsemane.

Chorus
	Alone He trod the winepress;
	He will ne’er forsake His own;
	He will succour those who labour,
	Weeping, praying, oft alone.

2. All alone before the rulers,
   He, their Saviour, stood disowned;
   Like a lamb before its shearers,
   He was silent, unrenowned;
   Fear not, then, to tread the winepress,
   With the Lord to lead and guide;
   He who stood alone will succour
   Those who in His love abide.

3. O’er all others He’s anointed
   With the oil of gladness true,
   Drinking in the Father’s kingdom
   Of the wine that’s ever new;
   And we soon shall share His glory
   If we share His suffering here;
   As we stand among the victors,
   God will dry our every tear.

   He gave His life for me,

   And take me home to share His joy

   His pure and holy mind,
   That all my inmost soul may be
   Unto His law inclined.

Chorus
	Most Holy Spirit, lead;
	O speed my feet to run,
	That I may gain the highest prize:
	The image of God’s Son.

   To do God’s holy will,
   With all my heart, my soul and strength,
   The law of love fulﬁl.

3. I need the mind of Christ,
   His fervent love and zeal,
   That I may daily grow in grace
   And gain the Spirit’s seal.

   To perfect me in holiness,
   In love and fear of God.

391: Calvary

1. Lord, we gather round Thy footstool,
   Bowed in deep humility;
   As we look upon the emblems,
   We remember Calvary.

Chorus
	Calvary, Calvary,
	We remember Calvary–
	In the bread Thy broken body,
	In the wine Thy blood we see.

2. In that night so dark with sorrow,
   Left alone in prayer to bow,
   See Him drink our cup of anguish,
   Drops of blood upon His brow.

3. See Him led outside the city,
   Bruised and bearing all our sin;
   Cruel was the death He suffered,
   Heaven’s joy for us to win.

4. Unto Him who loved and washed us
   From our sins in His own blood,
   We would render thanks and plead for
   Grace to love Him as we should.

392: We Would See Jesus

1. We would see Jesus, for the shadows lengthen
   Across this little landscape of our life;
   We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen,
   For the last weariness, the ﬁnal strife.

2. We would see Jesus, the great Rock Foundation,
   Whereon our feet were set with sovereign grace;
   Not life nor death, with all their agitation,
   Can thence remove us, if we see His face.

3. We would see Jesus– other lights are paling,
   Which for long years we have rejoiced to see;
   The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing;
   We would not mourn them, for we go to Thee.

4. We would see Jesus– this is all we’re needing:
   Strength, joy and willingness come with the sight.
   We would see Jesus, dying, risen, pleading;
   Then welcome day, and farewell mortal night.

   Christ redeemed me by His blood;
   For my sins He did atone,
   Called me, sealed me as His own;
   Henceforth all my life shall be
   Consecrated, Lord, to Thee.

2. Gracious Holy Spirit, live
   In my soul, and daily give
   Rich supplies of grace divine–
   Sanctify me wholly Thine;
   All my spirit, body, soul
   I resign to Thy control.

3. Help me, Lord, to daily die,
   Self in all its forms deny;
   Bid my carnal mind depart;
   Reign supreme within my heart;
   God of love and purity,
   Fix Thy dwelling-place in me.

4. Open Thou mine inward ear;
   Quicken all my soul to hear;
   Help me never to rebel,
   All self-will subdue, dispel;
   Thy most gracious Holy Will,
   Evermore in me fulﬁl.

5. Clothed in true humility,
   Let me ﬁnd my all in Thee;
   May Thy life in me increase,
   Love of self forever cease;
   Finish, Lord, Thy work begun–
   Mould and make me like Thy Son.

1. One little hour for watching with the Master,
   Eternal years to reign with Him in white.
   One little hour to bravely meet disaster,
   Eternal years to reign with Him in light.

Chorus
	Then, souls, be brave, and watch until the morrow!
	Awake! arise! your lamps of purpose trim.
	Your Saviour speaks across the night of sorrow;
	Can ye not watch one little hour with Him?

2. One little hour to suffer scorn and losses,
   Eternal years beyond earth’s cruel frowns.
   One little hour the storm and tempest tosses,
   Eternal years to wear unfading crowns.

396: A Little While

1. A little while to bear the cross

   To face the world, its scorn and frown,
   Before we lay our armour down.

Chorus
	Our little while will soon be gone;
	For us eternity will dawn;
	Redeem the time, O watch and pray!
	Labour for Jesus while you may.

2. A little while to ﬁght the ﬁght,
   Strong in His strength and Spirit’s might;
   The Lord is on our side, and we,
   Through Him, shall gain the victory.

3. A little while the course to run,
   And then eternity begun;
   We’ll see His face and share His bliss,
   Receive the crown of righteousness.

4. A little while the faith to keep
   And on the mountains seek His sheep,
   His precious gospel to proclaim
   And glorify the Master’s name.

397: Only Remembered

1. Fading away like the stars of the morning,
   Losing their light in the glorious sun–
   Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
   Only remembered by what we have done.

Chorus
	Only remembered, only remembered,
	Only remembered by what we have done;
	Thus would we pass from the earth and its toiling,
	Only remembered by what we have done.

2. Shall we be missed, though by others succeeded,
   Reaping the ﬁelds we in springtime have sown?
   Yes, but the sowers must pass from their labours,
   Ever remembered by what they have done.

3. Only the truth that in life we have spoken,
   Only the seed that on earth we have sown–
   These shall pass onward when we are forgotten:
   Fruits of the harvest and what we have done.

4. Oh, when the Saviour shall make up His jewels,

   All be remembered by what they have done.

   Of all things is drawing nigh.
   He shall soon appear in glory;
   And with loud, triumphant cry,

   Shall arise, no more to die.

2. Christ is coming, Christ is coming!
   And these bodies sorely tried,
   Which we yielded to His keeping,
   Shall be changed and gloriﬁed.
   Deeper fellowship forever,
   Deeper joys we then shall know;
   Unto God, Almighty Giver,
   Songs of praise shall ever ﬂow.

3. Christ is coming, Christ is coming!
   Let us wisely now prepare;
   If we taste of His rejection,
   In His glory we shall share.
   Now forsaking earthly pleasure,

   When He comes, in fullest measure
   All His glory to display.

399: In Vain Do the Wise

1. In vain do the wise seek to pierce through the veil
   That’s hiding the future from view;
   The Lord by His word sheds a light on our path,
   The sages of earth cannot do.

Chorus
	We pass through the shadows; we carry our cross,
	Esteeming things earthly but refuse and dross;
	For this cause we faint not, midst scorning of men:
	We look for the star of His coming again.

2. We value the truth lived and taught by the Lord,
   And onward we press for the prize.
   Since Jesus, the Master, our pathway has trod,
   The future can hold no surprise.

3. We fear not the future; we live not in doubt:
   The veil has been riven in twain.
   We cherish the words heard on Olivet’s brow:
   “This Jesus is coming again.”

4. It is not in vain that we run in the race,
   Nor vain, that the battle we ﬁght;

   The Lord will appear in our sight.

   Whether it be noon or night,
   Faithful to Him will He ﬁnd us watching,
   With our lamps all trimmed and bright?

Chorus
	Oh, can we say we are truly ready,
	Ready for the soul’s long home?
	Say, will He ﬁnd you and me still watching,
	Watching, waiting, when the Lord shall come?

2. If at the dawn of the early morning
   He shall call us one by one–
   When to the Lord we restore our talents,
   Will He answer us “Well done!”

3. Have we been true to the trust He left us?
   Do we seek to do our best?
   If in our hearts there is naught condemns us,
   We shall have a glorious rest.

4. Blessèd are those whom the Lord ﬁnds watching–

   Rob thee of thy love to do

402: Lord, Grant My Life

   A corn of wheat,
   Used here on earth for Thee
   In service sweet,
   Falling into the ground
   That fruit may thus abound,
   And with Thy blessings crowned
   Bring joy to Thee.

2. I long to prove to Thee
   My heart’s deep love,
   By seeking faithfully
   The things above;
   My heart condemneth me
   When keeping aught from Thee
   Or seeking selfishly
   My life to save.

3. The things of time have lost
   Their charm for me;
   Thy sacriﬁce that cost
   So much to Thee
   Doth show me what Thou art,
   Helping this sinful heart
   To choose the better part–
   Of serving Thee.

4. Forsaking all for Thee,
   I forward go,
   From love of earth set free
   While here below;
   The things above now claim
   First place, and in Thy name
   I’ll seek, through joy or pain,
   Thy kingdom ﬁrst.

Chorus
	Impelled by love I’ll go again
	To seek the lost and dying men,
	For in my heart there is a ﬂame
	Of burning love for Jesus’ name.

2. I hear the bleating of the sheep
   And see the little lambs to keep;
   I listen to the sinner’s plea
   And say again, “Dear Lord, send me.”

3. I could not question “Is it I?”
   When millions live in sin to die,
   But ask that all that in me lie
   Would always answer “Here am I.”

4. His precious name I want to bear
   In answer to His loving care;
   And more like Jesus I would be,

404: There Is No Gain

1. There is no gain but by a loss:
   Thus Jesus taught, who bore the cross;
   A corn of wheat, to multiply,
   Must fall into the ground and die;
   Oh, should a soul alone remain,
   When it a hundredfold may gain?

2. Who saves his life or cross would shun
   Loses ten thousand, holding one;
   And he who fain his life would spare,
   Keeps from the multitude their share.
   Oh, who can hear the needy cry
   And yet refuse in love to die?

3. Wherever you ripe ﬁelds behold,
   Waving to God their sheaves of gold,
   Be sure some corn of wheat has died,
   Some faithful life been cruciﬁed;
   Someone has suffered, wept and prayed,
   And fought hell’s legions undismayed.

1. Lord, let me hear once more the call to labour,
   The call that rang beside blue Galilee,
   To turn from home and lands and friends and kindred:
   Speak, Lord, again and say “Come, follow me.”

2. Lift Thou mine eyes to see the ﬁelds now waiting
   Close to my hand or far beyond the sea;
   Then let me go and give my life, Lord Jesus,
   Sowing or reaping, all as unto Thee.

3. Help me to see as sheep who have no shepherd,
   The multitudes that throng on every side;
   And let me say, wherever they may wander,
   “These are the souls for whom my Saviour died.”

4. Touch Thou my heart with Thine own deep compassion,
   Help me to love as Thou hast ﬁrst loved me;
   And put within, a burning, deep ambition
   To guide some lost and wandering soul to Thee.

5. O keep me, Lord, from growing cold or careless,
   But let my zeal and love still stronger be;
   And till the day when Thou shalt come, Lord Jesus,
   Let me be found still labouring for Thee.

406: Forget Them Not

1. Forget them not: the faithful band

   To bear the truth to every land,
   As debtors to mankind.

2. Forget them not in solitude,
   When breathing earnest prayer,
   That God may think on them for good
   And bless them everywhere.

3. Forget them not: the toilers brave
   Who scatter forth the seed;
   To Jesus they are willing slaves,
   Touched by a world in need.

4. Forget them not, for Jesus’ sake:
   No selfish quest have they;
   The daily cross they humbly take;
   Forget them not, I pray.

   Hear and believe the gospel true;
   For them our hearts are stirred.

1. O say not ye, “’Tis four more months till harvest.”
   Think not in heart, “There’s time to tarry here.”
   Go forth among the labourers who are weary;
   Give of your strength, their loving burden share.

2. O say not ye, “I am not ﬁt to labour.”
   God knows your heart, the struggles that lie there.
   ’Tis not your might or strength that will sustain you,
   But by God’s power, His holy name you’ll bear.

3. Lift up your eyes and see the weary, fainting,
   Wounded by life, with no help far or near.
   Yield all you have, wait not until tomorrow;
   Go forth to them and manifest God’s care.

4. Lift up your eyes, the ﬁelds are white and waiting;
   It matters not what you must leave behind.
   Before the precious grains are trampled under,
   Go, glean the ﬁelds while yet the Lord gives time.

5. Remember, when the harvest is all gathered,
   And sheaves are bound, and chaff is cast aside,
   Who sows and reaps will both rejoice together
   And in eternal love will then abide.

1. No reputation, with Jesus I go,
   Willingly, cheerfully, my life to sow.
   Sow to the Spirit, in faith lay it down;
   Strive for the mastery, hope for the crown.

2. No reputation, if Jesus had none;
   Why should I murmur, the suffering shun?
   Why from the cross should I seek for release?
   I must diminish for Him to increase.

3. No reputation, but with Him I crave
   Glory immortal, beyond the dark grave,
   Honour and glory which never can fade;
   Scorners are silent, there’s none to upbraid.

4. No reputation and unrecognized,
   Misunderstood and by worldlings despised,
   God understands me– this thought will sufﬁce;
   Bearing the cross, I should ever rejoice.

5. No reputation, with Him I’m content,
   Laying my life down, to spend and be spent;

Chorus
	Alone with God, the world forbidden;
	Alone with God, oh, blest retreat!
	Alone with God, and in Him hidden,
	To hold with Him communion sweet.

2. What though the clouds have gathered o’er me!
   What though I’ve passed beneath the rod!
   God’s perfect will there lies before me,
   When I am thus alone with God.

3. ’Tis there I ﬁnd new strength for duty,
   As o’er the sands of time I plod;
   I see the King in all His beauty,
   While resting there alone with God.

4. And when I see the moment nearing

   When time with me is disappearing,
   I want to be alone with God.

3. Called home to rest, dark night has sped forever;

2. Though dark the valley that lies before me,
   A light far brighter than noonday sun
   Shines o’er my pathway, and hope eternal
   I see in Jesus; earth’s day is done.

3. I look to Jesus, bright Star to guide me;
   ’Twas Jesus vanquished death and the grave;
   ’Twas Jesus only bore my transgression,
   For Jesus only my soul could save.
